This statement can be taken as indicating that between certain lines and points a relation holds, that a point can be an end of a line.  It doesn&rsquo;t say what ends are.  It also doesn&rsquo;t indicate how many ends a line can have.  For instance, the circumference of a circle has no ends, but a finite line has its two end points.
