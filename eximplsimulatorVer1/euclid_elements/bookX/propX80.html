<h1>Proposition 80</h1>

<div class="statement">To a first apotome of a medial straight line only one medial straight line can be annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a rational rectangle.</div>

<div class="just"><a href=propX74.html>X.74</a></div>
<p>Let <i>AB</i> be a first apotome of a medial straight line, and let <i>KC</i> be an annex to <i>AB</i>. Then <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only such that the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> which they contain is rational.

<p>I say that no other medial straight line can be annexed to <i>AB</i> which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a rational area.

<div class="just"><a href=propX74.html>X.74</a></div>
<p>If possible, let <i>DB</i> also be so annexed.  Then <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only such that the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> which they contain is rational.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookII/propII7.html>II.7</a></div>
<p>Now, since the excess of the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> over twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> is also the excess of the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> over twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i>, for they exceed by the same, the square on <i>AB</i>, therefore, alternately, the excess of the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> over the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> is also the excess of twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> over twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i>.

<p>But twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> exceeds twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> by a rational area, for both are rational.

<br><a href=propX26.html>X.26</a></div>
<p>Therefore the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> also exceeds the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> by a rational area, which is impossible, for both are medial, and a medial area does not exceed a medial by a rational area.

<p>Therefore, <i>to a first apotome of a medial straight line only one medial straight line can be annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a rational rectangle.</i>
