<h4>About the Definitions</h4>

The <i>Elements</i> begins with a list of definitions.  Some of these indicate little more than certain concepts will be discussed, such as <a href=defI1.html>Def.I.1</a>, <a
href=defI2.html>Def.I.2</a>, and <a href=defI5.html>Def.I.5</a>, which
introduce the terms point, line, and surface. (Note that for Euclid, the concept of line includes curved lines.) Others are substantial definitions which actually describe new concepts in terms of old ones.  For example, <a href=defI10.html>Def.I.10</a> defines a <i>right angle</i> as one of two equal adjacent angles made when one straight line meets another.  Other definitions look like they&rsquo;re substantial, but actually are not. For instance, <a href=defI4.html>Def.I.4</a> says a <i>straight line</i> &ldquo;is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.&rdquo;  No where in the <i>Elements</i> is the defining phrase &ldquo;which lies evenly with the points on itself&rdquo; applicable.  Thus, this definition indicates, at most, that some lines under discussion will be straight lines.

<p>It has been suggested that the definitions were added to the <i>Elements</i> sometime after Euclid wrote them.  Another possibility is that they are actually from a different work, perhaps older. In <a href=defI22.html>Def.I.22</a> special kinds of quadrilaterals are defined including square, oblong (a rectangle that are not squares), rhombus (equilateral but not a square), and rhomboid (parallelogram but not a rhombus). Except for squares, these other shapes are not mentioned in the <i>Elements.</i>  Euclid does use parallelograms, but they&rsquo;re not defined in this definition.  Also, the exclusive nature of some of these terms&#151;the part that indicates not a square&#151;is contrary to Euclid&rsquo;s practice of accepting squares and rectangles as kinds of parallelograms.

<h4>About the Postulates</h4>

Following the list of definitions is a list of postulates.  Each postulate is an axiom&#151;which means a statement which is accepted without proof&#151 specific to the subject matter, in this case, plane geometry.  Most of them are constructions.  For instance, <a href=post1.html>Post.I.1</a> says a straight line can be drawn between two points, and <a href=post3.html>Post.I.3</a> says a circle can be drawn given a specified point to be the center and another point to be on the circumference.  The fourth postulate, <a href=post4.html>Post.I.4</a>, is not a construction, but says that all right angles are equal.

<h4>About magnitudes and the Common Notions</h4>

The Common Notions are also axioms, but they refer to magnitudes of various kinds.  The kind of magnitude that  appears most frequently is that of straight line.  Other important kinds are angles, plane figures, and solid figures

<p>In proposition <a href=../bookIII/propIII16.html>III.16</a> (but nowhere else) angles with curved sides are compared with rectilinear angles which shows that rectilinear angles are to be considered as a special kind of plane angle.  That agrees with Euclid&rsquo;s definition of them in <a href=defI9.html>I.Def.9</a> and <a href=defI8.html>I.Def.8</a>.

<p>Also in Book III, parts of circumferences of circles, that is, arcs, appear as magnitudes.  Only arcs of equal circles can be compared or added, so arcs of equal circles comprise a kind of magnitude, while arcs of unequal circles are magnitudes of different kinds.  These kinds are all different from straight lines.  Whereas areas of figures are comparable, different kinds of curves are not.

<p>Book V includes the general theory of ratios.  No particular kind of magnitude is specified in that book.  It may come as a surprise that ratios do not themselves form a kind of magnitude since they can be compared, but they cannot be added.  See the guide on Book V for more information.

<p>Number theory is treated in Books VII through IX.  It could be considered that numbers form a kind of magnitude as pointed out by Aristotle.

<p>Beginning in Book XI, solids are considered, and they form the last kind of magnitude discussed in the <i>Elements.</i>

<h4>The propositions</h4>

Following the definitions, postulates, and common notions, there are 48 propositions.  Each of these propositions includes a statement followed by a proof of the statement.  Each statement of the proof is logically justified by a definition, postulate, common notion, or an earlier proposition that has already been proven.  There are gaps in the logic of some of the proofs, and these are mentioned in the commentaries after the propositions.  Also included in the proof is a diagram illustrating the proof.

<p>Some of the propositions are constructions.  A construction depends, ultimately, on the
constructive postulates about drawing lines and circles.  The first part of a proof for a constructive proposition is how to perform the construction.  The rest of the proof (usually the longer part), shows that the proposed construction actually satisfies the goal of the proposition.  In the list of propositions in each book, the constructions are displayed in red.

<p>Most of the propositions, however, are not constructions.  Their statements say that under certain conditions, certain other conditions logically follow.  For example, <a href=propI5.html>Prop.I.5</a> says that if a triangle has the property that two of its sides are equal, then it follows that the angles opposite these sides (called the &ldquo;base angles&rdquo;) are also equal.  Even the propositions that are not constructions may have constructions included in their proofs since auxiliary lines or circles may be needed in the explanation.  But the bulk of the proof is, as for the constructive propositions, a sequence of statements that are logically justified and which culminates in the statement of the proposition.

<h4>Logical structure of Book I</h4>

The various postulates and common notions are frequently used in Book I.  Only two of the propositions rely solely on the postulates and axioms, namely, <a href=propI1.html>I.1</a> and <a href=propI4.html>I.4</a>.  The logical chains of propositions in Book I are longer than in the other books; there are long sequences of propositions each relying on the previous.
