<dd>If an angle of a triangle is bisected by a straight line cutting the base, then the segments of the base have the same ratio as the remaining sides of the triangle; and, if segments of the base have the same ratio as the remaining sides of the triangle, then the straight line joining the vertex to the point of section bisects the angle of the triangle.

<p><dt><b><a href="propVI7.html">Proposition 7</a>.</b>
<dd>If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle, the sides about other angles proportional, and the remaining angles either both less or both not less than a right angle, then the triangles are equiangular and have those angles equal the sides about which are proportional.

<p><dt><b><a href="propVI8.html">Proposition 8</a>.</b>

<p><b><a href="propVI8.html#cor">Corollary</a>.</b>
If in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular is drawn from the right angle to the base, then the straight line so drawn is a mean proportional between the segments of the base.

<h3><a name=logic>Logical structure of Book VI</a></h3>

Proposition VI.1 is the basis for the entire of Book VI except the last proposition VI.33.  Only these two propositions directly use the definition of proportion in Book V.  Proposition VI.1 constructs a proportion between lines and figures while VI.33 constructs a proportion between angles and circumferences.  The intervening propositions use other properties of proportions developed in Book V, but they do not construct new proportions using the definition of proportion.
