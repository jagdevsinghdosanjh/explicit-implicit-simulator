<h1>Proposition 15</h1>

<div class="statement">If two straight lines cut one another, then they make the vertical angles equal to one another.</div>

<p>Let the straight lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> cut one another at the point <i>E.</i>

<p>I say that the angle <i>CEA</i> equals the angle <i>DEB,</i> and the angle <i>BEC</i> equals the angle <i>AED.</i>

</div>

<div class="just"><a href="propI13.html">I.13</a></div>
<p>Since the straight line <i>AE</i> stands on the straight line <i>CD</i> making the angles <i>CEA</i> and <i>AED,</i> therefore the sum of the angles <i>CEA</i> and <i>AED</i> equals two right angles.

<div class="just"><a href="propI13.html">I.13</a></div>
<p>Again, since the straight line <i>DE</i> stands on the straight line <i>AB</i> making the angles <i>AED</i> and <i>DEB,</i> therefore the sum of the angles <i>AED</i> and <i>DEB</i> equals two right angles. 
 
<div class="just"><a href=post4.html>I.Post.4</a>
<br><a href=cn.html>C.N.1</a>
<br><a href=cn.html>C.N.3</a></div>
<p>But the sum of the angles <i>CEA</i> and <i>AED</i> was also proved equal to two right angles, therefore the sum of the angles <i>CEA</i> and <i>AED</i> equals the sum of the angles <i>AED</i> and <i>DEB.</i>  Subtract the angle <i>AED</i> from each.  Then the remaining angle <i>CEA</i> equals the remaining angle <i>DEB.</i>

<p>Similarly it can be proved that the angles <i>BEC</i> and <i>AED</i> are also equal.

<p>Therefore <i>if two straight lines cut one another, then they make the vertical angles equal to one another.</i>

<a name=cor><h3>Corollary</h3></a>
From this it is manifest that, <i>if two straight lines cut one another, then they make the angles at the point of section equal to four right angles.</i>

Although the term vertical angles is not defined in the list of definitions at the beginning of Book I, its meaning is clear form its use in this proposition.  Vertical angles are angles across a vertex that share lines as their sides.

<p>A <i>corollary</i> that follows a proposition is a statement that immediately follows from the proposition or the proof in the proposition.  It is possible that this and the other corollaries in the <i>Elements</i> are interpolations inserted after Euclid wrote the <i>Elements.</i>  During the writing, he could have either bundled the corollary into the proposition or made it a separate proposition.

<h3>Proclus&rsquo;s Corollary</h3>
Proclus (412&ndash;485) includes another corollary: 
<i>If any number of straight lines intersect one another at one point, then the sum of all the angles so formed equals four right angles.</i>

<h4>Use of Proposition 15</h4>

This proposition is used in the next one, a few others in this book, <a href=../bookII/propII10.html>II.10</a>, <a href=../bookIV/propIV15.html>IV.15</a, and a few propositions in Book XI.
