<p>This statement indicates, at least, that the term &ldquo;straight line&rdquo; refers to a kind of line.  It is hard to tell what else it means, if anything.  Various commentators have interpreted in a variety of ways.  The definition of plane surface in <a href=defI7.html>I.Def.7</a> uses a similar language that is equally opaque.

<p>There are a some postulates that come a little later in Book I and give meaning to straight lines.  <a href=post1.html>I.Post.1</a> says that a straight line can be drawn between any two points, <a href=post2.html>I.Post.2</a> says that a straight line can be extended, and the remaining postulates use the concept of straight line in one way or another.
