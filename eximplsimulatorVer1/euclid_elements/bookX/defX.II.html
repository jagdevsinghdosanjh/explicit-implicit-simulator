<h1>Definitions II</h1>

<dl>
<a name=1><p><dt><h4>Definition 1.</h4></a>
<dd>Given a rational straight line and a binomial, divided into its terms, such that the square on the greater term is greater than the square on the lesser by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with the greater, then, if the greater term is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, let the whole be called a <i>first binomial</i> straight line;

<a name=2><p><dt><h4>Definition 2.</h4></a>
<dd>But if the lesser term is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, let the whole be called a <i>second binomial</i>;

<a name=3><p><dt><h4>Definition 3.</h4></a>
<dd>And if neither of the terms is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, let the whole be called a <i>third binomial.</i>

<a name=4><p><dt><h4>Definition 4.</h4></a>
<dd>Again, if the square on the greater term is greater than the square on the lesser by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with the greater, then, if the greater term is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, let the whole be called a <i>fourth binomial</i>;

<a name=5><p><dt><h4>Definition 5.</h4></a>
<dd>If the lesser, a <i>fifth binomial</i>;

<a name=6><p><dt><h4>Definition 6.</h4></a>
<dd>And, if neither, a <i>sixth binomial</i>.
