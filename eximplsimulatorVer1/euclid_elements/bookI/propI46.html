<h1>Proposition 46</h1>

<div class="statement">To describe a square on a given straight line.</div>

<p>Let <i>AB</i> be the given straight line.
<p>It is required to describe a square on the straight line <i>AB.</i>

<p>Draw <i>AC</i> at right angles to the straight line <i>AB</i> from the point <i>A</i> on it.  Make <i>AD</i> equal to <i>AB.</i>  Draw <i>DE</i> through the point <i>D</i> parallel to <i>AB,</i> and draw <i>BE</i> through the point <i>B</i> parallel to <i>AD.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="propI34.html">I.34</a></div>
<p>Then <i>ADEB</i> is a parallelogram. Therefore <i>AB</i> equals <i>DE,</i> and <i>AD</i> equals <i>BE.</i>

<p>But <i>AB</i> equals <i>AD,</i> therefore the four straight lines <i>BA, AD, DE,</i> and <i>EB</i> equal one another. Therefore the parallelogram <i>ADEB</i> is equilateral.

<p>I say next that it is also right-angled.

<div class="just"><a href="propI29.html">I.29</a></div>
<p>Since the straight line <i>AD</i> falls upon the parallels <i>AB</i> and <i>DE,</i> therefore the sum of the angles <i>BAD</i> and <i>ADE</i> equals two right angles.

<div class="just"><a href=post4.html>I.Post.4</a></div>
<p>But the angle <i>BAD</i> is right, therefore the angle <i>ADE</i> is also right.

<div class="just"><a href="propI34.html">I.34</a></div>
<p>And in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles equal one another, therefore each of the opposite angles <i>ABE</i> and <i>BED</i> is also right. Therefore <i>ADEB</i> is right-angled.

<p>And it was also proved equilateral.

<div class="just"><a href=defI22.html>I.Def.22</a></div>
<p>Therefore it is a square, and it is described on the straight line <i>AB.</i>

We now have the second regular polygon, the first being the equilateral triangle of proposition <a href=propI1.html>I.1</a>.  Regular polygons with 5, 6, and 15 sides are constructed in <a href=../bookIV/bookIV.html>Book IV</a>.
<h4>Construction steps</h4>

<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>
There are quite a few steps needed to construct a square on <i>AB.</i>  In order to construct the perpendicular <i>AC,</i> first <i>AB</i> has to be extended in the direction of <i>A</i> and a point <i>F</i> on the far side the same distance from <i>A</i> as <i>B</i> is, then two more circles centered at <i>B</i> and <i>F</i> to get a perpendicular line, and then it needs to be cut off at length <i>C,</i> but fortunately, the needed circle has already been drawn.

<p>
Next, <i>EB</i> is to be drawn through <i>B</i> parallel to <i>AD.</i>  In general that construction given in <a href=propI31.html>I.31</a> takes six circles, but in this case if <i>EB</i> is drawn perpendicular to <i>AB,</i> then it will be parallel to <i>AD,</i> too, and that construction only takes three circles with radii <i>BA, AG,</i> and <i>GA.</i>

<p>This abbreviation of Euclid&rsquo;s construction requires six circles and four lines.  There are alternate constructions that are a bit shorter.

<h4>Use of Proposition 46</h4>

The construction of a square given in this proposition is used in the next proposition, numerous propositions in Book II, and others in Books VI, XII, and XIII.
