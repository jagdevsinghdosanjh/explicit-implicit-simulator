<h1>About the Text</h1>

This text of this version of Euclid&rsquo;s <i>Elements</i> is similar to Heath's edition which he translated from Heiberg's definitive edition in Greek, but it is slightly less literal to make it more readable.

Heath's excellent critical commentary is as important as the text itself, and since Heath's edition is in publication (Dover), a purchase of that edition is recommended.  The text of Heath's translation of Euclid&rsquo;s <i>Elements</i> is also available on-line at the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/">Perseus Project</a> at Tuft's University starting with the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/newtext?lookup=euc.+elem.+1+def.+1&vers=">first definition of book I</a>.  Not just Heath's translation, but his commentary as well as the Greek text is available at the Perseus Project.  (The figures are not included.)
