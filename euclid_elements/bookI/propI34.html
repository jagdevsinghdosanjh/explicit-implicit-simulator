<h1>Proposition 34</h1>

<div class="statement">In parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles equal one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.</div>

<p>Let <i>ACDB</i> be a parallelogrammic area, and <i>BC</i> its diameter.

<p>I say that the opposite sides and angles of the parallelogram <i>ACDB</i> equal one another, and the diameter <i>BC</i> bisects it.

<div class="just"><a href=propI29.html>I.29</a></div>
<p>Since <i>AB</i> is parallel to <i>CD,</i> and the straight line <i>BC</i> falls upon them, therefore the alternate angles <i>ABC</i> and <i>BCD</i> equal one another.

<div class="just"><a href=propI29.html>I.29</a></div>
<p>Again, since <i>AC</i> is parallel to <i>BD,</i> and <i>BC</i> falls upon them, therefore the alternate angles <i>ACB</i> and <i>CBD</i> equal one another.

<div class="just"><a href=propI26.html>I.26</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>ABC</i> and <i>DCB</i> are two triangles having the two angles <i>ABC</i> and <i>BCA</i> equal to the two angles <i>DCB</i> and <i>CBD</i> respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely that adjoining the equal angles and common to both of them, <i>BC.</i> Therefore they also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle. Therefore the side <i>AB</i> equals <i>CD,</i> and <i>AC</i> equals <i>BD,</i> and further the angle <i>BAC</i> equals the angle <i>CDB.</i>

<div class="just"><a href=cn.html>C.N.2</a></div>
<p>Since the angle <i>ABC</i> equals the angle <i>BCD,</i> and the angle <i>CBD</i> equals the angle <i>ACB,</i> therefore the whole angle <i>ABD</i> equals the whole angle <i>ACD.</i>

<p>And the angle <i>BAC</i> was also proved equal to the angle <i>CDB.</i>

<p>Therefore in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles equal one another.

<p>I say, next, that the diameter also bisects the areas.

<div class="just"><a href=propI4.html>I.4</a></div>
<p>Since <i>AB</i> equals <i>CD,</i> and <i>BC</i> is common, the two sides <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> equal the two sides <i>DC</i> and <i>CB</i> respectively, and the angle <i>ABC</i> equals the angle <i>BCD.</i> Therefore the base <i>AC</i> also equals <i>DB,</i> and the triangle <i>ABC</i> equals the triangle <i>DCB.</i>

<p>Therefore the diameter <i>BC</i> bisects the parallelogram <i>ACDB.</i>

<p>Therefore <i>in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles equal one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.</i>

In this proposition Euclid  uses the term &ldquo;parallelogrammic area&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;parallelogram&rdquo; which first occurs in the next proposition.  
Proclus indicated that the word &ldquo;parallelogram&rdquo; was created by Euclid.  

<p>This proposition begins the study of areas of rectilinear figures.  It is a modest beginning, but it allows the comparison of triangles and parallelograms so that problems and results concerning one can be converted to problems and results concerning the other.

<h4>Use of Proposition 34</h4>

This proposition is used in the next four propositions and some others in Book I, several in Book II, a few in Books IV, VI, X, XI, and XII.
