<p>Prime numbers form a very important class of numbers, and much of number theory is devoted to their analysis.  The only proper divisor of a prime number is 1.  The first few prime numbers are, of course, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11.  Those numbers that aren&rsquo;t prime are composite, for instance, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10.
The number 1 holds a special position.  For Euclid, it was the unit rather than a number.  For modern mathematicians 1 is also a unit, but in a different sense of the word, since it has a reciprocal, namely, itself.

<p>Numbers are  relatively prime if their only common divisor is 1.  For example, 6 and 35 are relatively prime (although neither is a prime number in itself).  This situation is also phrased as &ldquo;6 is prime to 35.&rdquo; For another example, the three numbers 6, 10, and 15 are relatively prime since no number (except 1) divides all three.  If the numbers aren&rsquo;t relatively prime, then they&rsquo;re called &ldquo;relatively composite,&rdquo; a rarely used term.
