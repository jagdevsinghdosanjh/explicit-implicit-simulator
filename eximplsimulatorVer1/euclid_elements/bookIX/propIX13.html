<h1>Proposition 13</h1>

<div class="statement">If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in continued proportion, and the number after the unit is prime, then the greatest is not measured by any except those which have a place among the proportional numbers.</div>

<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <i>A, B, C,</i> and <i>D,</i> beginning from a unit and in continued proportion, and let <i>A,</i> the number after the unit, be prime.

<p>I say that <i>D,</i> the greatest of them, is not measured by any other number except <i>A, B,</i> or <i>C.</i>

<p>If possible, let it be measured by <i>E,</i> and let <i>E</i> not be the same with any of the numbers <i>A, B,</i> or <i>C.</i>

<p>It is then clear that <i>E</i> is not prime, for if <i>E</i> is prime and measures <i>D,</i> then it also measures <i>A,</i> which is prime, though it is not the same with it, which is impossible. Therefore <i>E</i> is not prime, so it is composite.

<div class="just"><a href="../bookVII/propVII31.html">VII.31</a></div>
<p>But any composite number is measured by some prime number, therefore <i>E</i> is measured by some prime number.

<p>I say next that it is no measured by any other prime except <i>A.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="propIX12.html">IX.12</a></div>
If <i>E</i> is measured by another, and <i>E</i> measures <i>D,</i> then that other measures <i>D,</i> so that it also measures <i>A,</i> which is prime, though it is not the same with it, which is impossible. Therefore [only the prime] <i>A</i> measures <i>E.</i>

<p>And, since <i>E</i> measures <i>D,</i> let it measure it according to <i>F.</i>

<p>I say that <i>F</i> is not the same with any of the numbers <i>A, B,</i> or <i>C.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="propIX11.html">IX.11</a></div>
<p>If <i>F</i> is the same with one of the numbers <i>A, B,</i> or <i>C,</i> and measures <i>D</i> according to <i>E,</i> then one of the numbers <i>A, B,</i> or <i>C</i> also measures <i>D</i> according to <i>E.</i> But one of the numbers <i>A, B,</i> or <i>C</i> measures <i>D</i> according to some one of the numbers <i>A, B,</i> or <i>C,</i> therefore <i>E</i> is also the same with one of the numbers <i>A, B</i> or <i>C,</i> which is contrary to the hypothesis.

<p>Therefore <i>F</i> is not the same as any one of the numbers <i>A, B,</i> or <i>C.</i>

<p>Similarly we can prove that <i>F</i> is measured by <i>A,</i> by proving again that <i>F</i> is not prime.

<div class="just"><a href="propIX12.html">IX.12</a></div>
<p>If it is, and measures <i>D,</i> then it also measures <i>A,</i> which is prime, though it is not the same with it, which is impossible. Therefore <i>F</i> is not prime, so it is composite.

<p>And, since <i>E</i> measures <i>D</i> according to <i>F,</i> therefore <i>E</i> multiplied by <i>F</i> makes <i>D.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="propIX11.html">IX.11</a></div>
<p>But, further, <i>A</i> multiplied by <i>C</i> makes <i>D,</i> therefore the product of <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> equals the product of <i>E</i> and <i>F.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookVII/propVII19.html">VII.19</a></div>
<p>Therefore, proportionally <i>A</i> is to <i>E</i> as <i>F</i> is to <i>C.</i>

<p>But <i>A</i> measures <i>E,</i> therefore <i>F</i> also measures <i>C.</i> Let it measure it according to <i>G.</i>

<p>Similarly, then, we can prove that <i>G</i> is not the same with any of the numbers <i>A</i> or <i>B,</i> and that it is measured by <i>A.</i> And, since <i>F</i> measures <i>C</i> according to <i>G,</i> therefore <i>F</i> multiplied by <i>G</i> makes <i>C.</i>

<p>But, further, <i>A</i> multiplied by <i>B</i> makes <i>C,</i> therefore the product of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> equals the product of <i>F</i> and <i>G.</i> Therefore, proportionally <i>A</i> is to <i>F</i> as <i>G</i> is to <i>B.</i>

<p>But <i>A</i> measures <i>F,</i> therefore <i>G</i> also measures <i>B.</i> Let it measure it according to <i>H.</i>

<p>Similarly then we can prove that <i>H</i> is not the same with <i>A.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="propIX8.html">IX.8</a></div>
<p>And, since <i>G</i> measures <i>B</i> according to <i>H,</i> therefore <i>G</i> multiplied by <i>H</i> makes <i>B.</i> But, further, <i>A</i> multiplied by itself makes <i>B,</i> therefore the product of <i>H</i> and <i>G</i> equals the square on <i>A.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookVII/propVII19.html">VII.19</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>H</i> is to <i>A</i> as <i>A</i> is to <i>G.</i>  But <i>A</i> measures <i>G,</i> therefore <i>H</i> also measures <i>A,</i> which is prime, though it is not the same with it, which is absurd.

<p>Therefore <i>D</i> the greatest is not measured by any other number except <i>A, B,</i> or <i>C.</i>

<p>Therefore, <i>if as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in continued proportion, and the number after the unit is prime, then the greatest is not measured by any except those which have a place among the proportional numbers.</i>

<h2>Guide</h2>

This proposition says that the only numbers that can divide a power of a prime are smaller powers of that prime.

<h4>Outline of the proof</h4>

The proof involves a reduction step like that in the proof of the previous proposition.

<p>Suppose a number <i>e</i> divides a power <i>p</i><sup><i>k</i></sup> of a prime number <i>p,</i> but <i>e</i> does not equal any lower power of <i>p.</i>

<p>First note that <i>e</i> can&rsquo;t be prime itself, since then it would divide <i>p</i> (<a href="propIX12.html">IX.12</a>), which it doesn&rsquo;t.

<p>Then <i>e</i> is composite.  Then some prime number <i>q</i> divides <i>e</i> (<a href="../bookVII/propVII31.html">VII.31</a>).  Then <i>q</i> also divides <i>p</i><sup><i>k</i></sup>, which it implies <i>q</i> divides <i>p.</i>  Therefore, the only prime that can divide <i>e</i> is <i>p.</i>

<p>The rest of the proof is repeated reduction of the power <i>k.</i>  Since <i>e</i> is not 1, it is divisible by <i>p.</i>  Let <i>g</i> be <i>e/p.</i>  Then <i>g</i> divides <i>p</i><sup><i>k</i>-1</sup>, but is not any lower power of <i>p.</i> Then the same argument can be applied.  Continue in this manner until some number divides <i>p</i> but is not 1 or <i>p,</i> a contradiction.  Thus, the  only numbers that can divide a power of a prime are smaller powers of the prime.

<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>

This proposition is used in <a href=propIX32.html>IX.32</a> and <a href=propIX36.html>IX.36</a>.
