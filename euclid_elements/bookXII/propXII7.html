<h1>Proposition 7</h1>

<div class="statement">
Any prism with a triangular base is divided into three pyramids equal to one another with triangular bases.</div>

<p>Let there be a prism with the triangular base <i>ABC</i> and <i>DEF</i> opposite.
<p>I say that the prism <i>ABCDEF</i> is divided into three pyramids equal to one another, which have triangular bases.

<p>Since <i>ABED</i> is a parallelogram, and <i>BD</i> is its diameter, therefore the triangle <i>ABD</i> equals the triangle <i>EBD.</i> Therefore the pyramid with triangular base <i>ABD</i>  and vertex <i>C</i> equals the pyramid with triangular base <i>DEB</i> and vertex <i>C.</i>

<p>But the pyramid with triangular base <i>DEB</i>  and vertex <i>C</i> is identical with the pyramid with triangular base <i>EBC</i> and vertex <i>D,</i> for they are contained by the same planes.

<p>Therefore the pyramid with triangular base <i>ABD</i>  vertex <i>C</i> is also equal to the pyramid with triangular base <i>EBC</i> and vertex <i>D.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI34.html">I.34</a></div>
<p>Again, since <i>FCBE</i> is a parallelogram, and <i>CE</i> is its diameter, therefore the triangle <i>CEF</i> equals the triangle <i>CBE.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="propXII5.html">XII.5</a></div>
<p>Therefore the pyramid with triangular base <i>BCE</i> and vertex <i>D</i> equals the pyramid with triangular base <i>ECF</i> and vertex <i>D.</i>

<p>But the pyramid with triangular base <i>BCE</i>  and vertex <i>D</i> was proved equal to the pyramid with triangular base <i>ABD</i> and vertex <i>C,</i> therefore the pyramid with triangular base <i>CEF</i> and vertex <i>D</i> equals the pyramid with triangular base <i>ABD</i> and vertex <i>C.</i>  Therefore the prism <i>ABCDEF</i> is divided into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases.

<p>And, since the pyramid with triangular base <i>ABD</i> and vertex <i>C</i> is identical with the pyramid with triangular base <i>CAB</i> and vertex <i>D,</i> for they are contained by the same planes, while the pyramid with triangular base <i>ABD</i>  vertex <i>C</i> was proved to be a third of the prism with triangular base <i>ABC</i>  and <i>DEF</i> opposite, therefore the pyramid with triangular base <i>ABC</i> and vertex <i>D</i> is a third of the prism with the same base <i>ABC,</i> and <i>DEF</i> opposite.</tr>

<p>Therefore, <i>any prism with a triangular base is divided into three pyramids equal to one another with triangular bases.</i>

<h1>Corollary</h1>

<div class="statement">From this it is clear that any pyramid is a third part of the prism with the same base and equal height.</div>
</div>

<h2>Guide</h2>

The proof of this proposition is easier than it looks.  The triangles <i>ABD</i> and <i>EBD</i> are equal since each is half the parallelogram <i>ABED</i>. Now since the pyramids  <i>ABDC</i> and <i>DEBC</i> have equal bases and the same altitude, by <a href="propXII5.html">XII.5</a>, they are equal pyramids.  A similar argument shows pyramids  <i>BCED</i>and <i>ECFD</i> are equal.  But <i>DEBC</i>
and <i>BCED</i> are the same pyramid named differently.  So the prism is
divided into three equal pyramids.

<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>
This proposition is used in the next two propositions about volumes of pyramids and in <a href=propXII10.html>XII.10</a> following them about volumes of cones and cylinders.
