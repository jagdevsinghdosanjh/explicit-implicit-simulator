<p>Let <i>AC</i> and <i>CF</i> be equiangular parallelograms having the angle <i>BCD</i> equal to the angle <i>ECG.</i>

<p>Complete the parallelogram <i>DG.</i>  Set out a straight line <i>K,</i> and make it so that <i>BC</i> is to <i>CG</i> as <i>K</i> is to <i>L,</i> and <i>DC</i> is to <i>CE</i> as <i>L</i> is to <i>M.</i>

<p>Then the ratios of <i>K</i> to <i>L</i> and of <i>L</i> to <i>M</i> are the same as the ratios of the sides, namely of <i>BC</i> to <i>CG</i> and of <i>DC</i> to <i>CE.</i>

<p>But the ratio of <i>K</i> to <i>M</i> is compounded of the ratio of <i>K</i> to <i>L</i> and of that of <i>L</i> to <i>M,</i> so that <i>K</i> has also to <i>M</i> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.
 
<div class="just"><a href=propVI1.html>VI.1</a>
<br><a href="../bookV/propV11.html">V.11</a></div>
<p>Now since <i>BC</i> is to <i>CG</i> as the parallelogram <i>AC</i> is to the parallelogram <i>CH,</i> and <i>BC</i> is to <i>CG</i> as <i>K</i> is to <i>L,</i> therefore <i>K</i> is to <i>L</i> as <i>AC</i> is to <i>CH.</i>

<div class="just"><a href=propVI1.html>VI.1</a>
<br><a href="../bookV/propV11.html">V.11</a></div>
<p>Again, since <i>DC</i> is to <i>CE</i> as the parallelogram <i>CH</i> is to <i>CF,</i>  and <i>DC</i> is to <i>CE</i> as <i>L</i> is to <i>M,</i> therefore <i>L</i> is to <i>M</i> as the parallelogram <i>CH</i> is to the parallelogram <i>CF.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV22.html">V.22</a></div>
<p>Since then it was proved that <i>K</i> is to <i>L</i> as the parallelogram <i>AC</i> is to the parallelogram <i>CH,</i> and <i>L</i> is to <i>M</i> as the parallelogram <i>CH</i> is to the parallelogram <i>CF,</i> therefore, <i>ex aequali K</i> is to <i>M</i> as <i>AC</i> is to the parallelogram <i>CF.</i>

<p>But <i>K</i> has to <i>M</i> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides, therefore <i>AC</i> also has to <i>CF</i> the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.

<p>Therefore, <i>equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides.</i>

<p>This proposition is a generalization of the basic formula for the area of a rectangle, that is, the area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width.  Such a formula depends on predetermined units of length and area so that the unit area is the area of a square whose sides have length equal to the unit length.  Euclid and other Greek mathematicians did not use predetermined units of length or area, so they expressed this formula as a proportion. We would state that proportion as saying the ratio of the area of a given rectangle to the area of a given square is the product of the ratios of the lengths of the sides of the rectangle to the length of a side of the square.  Of course, Euclid would say that without using the words area and length as follows: the ratio of the a given rectangle to a given square is the product of the ratios of the sides of the rectangle to a side of the square.  

<p>Note that his terminology for a product of ratios involves &ldquo;compounding the ratios.&rdquo;  A natural generalization of the ratio of a rectangle to a square is the ratio of a rectangle to a rectangle.  A broader generalization is the ratio of one parallelogram to another parallelogram having the same angles.  That gives the generalization as stated in this proposition.

<h4>Areas of rectangles and parallelograms</h4>

These areas have been treated earlier in the <i>Elements.</i>
Back in Book I and II the basic concept was &ldquo;quadrature,&rdquo; that is, finding a square or
other shaped figure of the same area as the given rectangle or parallelogram.  That began with Proposition <a href="../bookI/propI35.html">I.35</a> which said two triangles on the same base and
with the same height are equal, and ended with <a href="../bookII/propII14.html">I.14</a> which constructed a square equal to a given rectangle.

<p>Early in this book was the proposition <a href="propVI1.html">VI.1</a> generalizing I.35 which said that parallelograms with the same height are proportional to their bases.  Finally, in this proposition we have the full statement about areas of rectangles and parallelograms.

<h4>Analogous statements in other books</h4>

Proposition <a href="../bookVIII/propVIII5.html">VIII.5</a> states that plane numbers have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides.  That proposition is probably a much older version that may go back to the Pythagoreans when &ldquo;all was number.&rdquo;  The discovery of incommensurable lines showed there were serious limitations to that version of the proposition.

<p>In <a href="../bookXI/bookXI.html">Book XI</a> there are analogous statements for volumes of parallelepipeds.  For instance, Proposition <a href="../bookXI/propXI33.html">XI.33</a> states that similar parallelepipeds are to one another in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides.  That statement for parallelepipeds is analogous to this one for parallelograms.

<h4>Use of this theorem</h4>

Although this is a basic proposition on areas, it is actually not used in the rest of the
<i>Elements.</i>
