<h1>Proposition 66</h1>

<div class="statement">A straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is itself also binomial and the same in order.</div>

<p>Let <i>AB</i> be binomial, and let <i>CD</i> be commensurable in length with <i>AB</i>.

<p>I say that <i>CD</i> is binomial and the same in order with <i>AB</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX36.html>X.36</a></div>
<p>Since <i>AB</i> is binomial, divide it into its terms at <i>E</i>, and let <i>AE</i> be the greater term, therefore <i>AE</i> and <i>EB</i> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookVI/propVI12.html>VI.12</a>,
<a href=../bookV/propV19.html>V.19</a></div>
<p>Let it be contrived that <i>AB</i> is to <i>CD</i> as <i>AE</i> is to <i>CF</i>. Then the remainder <i>EB</i> is to the remainder <i>FD</i> as <i>AB</i> is to <i>CD</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX11.html>X.11</a></div>
<p>But <i>AB</i> is commensurable in length with <i>CD</i>, therefore <i>AE</i> is also commensurable with <i>CF</i>, and <i>EB</i> with <i>FD</i>.

<p>And <i>AE</i> and <i>EB</i> are rational, therefore <i>CF</i> and <i>FD</i> are also rational.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV11.html>V.11</a>,
<a href=../bookV/propV16.html>V.16</a></div>
<p>And <i>AE</i> is to <i>CF</i> as <i>EB</i> is to <i>FD</i>.  Therefore, alternately, <i>AE</i> is to <i>EB</i> as <i>CF</i> is to <i>FD</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX11.html>X.11</a></div>
<p>But <i>AE</i> and <i>EB</i> are commensurable in square only, therefore <i>CF</i> and <i>FD</i> are also commensurable in square only.

<div class="just"><a href=propX36.html>X.36</a></div>
<p>And they are rational, therefore <i>CD</i> is binomial.

<p>I say next that it is the same in order with <i>AB</i>.

<p>For the square on <i>AE</i> is greater than the square on <i>EB</i> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <i>AE</i> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.

<div class="just"><a href=propX14.html>X.14</a></div>
<p>If then the square on <i>AE</i> is greater than the square on <i>EB</i> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <i>AE</i>, then the square on <i>CF</i> is also greater than the square on <i>FD</i> by the square on a straight line commensurable with <i>CF</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX12.html>X.12</a>
<br><a href=defX.II.html#1>X.Def.II.1</a></div>
<p>And, if <i>AE</i> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, then <i>CF</i> is also commensurable with it, and for this reason each of the straight lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> is a first binomial, that is, the same in order.

<div class="just"><a href=propX12.html>X.12</a>
<br><a href=defX.II.html#2>X.Def.II.2</a></div>
<p>But, if <i>EB</i> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, then <i>FD</i> is also commensurable with it,  and for this reason again <i>CD</i> is the same in order with <i>AB</i>, for each of them is a second binomial.

<div class="just"><a href=propX13.html>X.13</a>
<br><a href=defX.II.html#3>X.Def.II.3</a></div>
<p>But, if neither of the straight lines <i>AE</i> nor <i>EB</i> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, then neither of the straight lines <i>CF</i> nor <i>FD</i> is commensurable with it,  and each of the straight lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> is a third binomial.

<div class="just"><a href=propX14.html>X.14</a></div>
<p>But, if the square on <i>AE</i> is greater than the square on <i>EB</i> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <i>AE</i>, then the square on <i>CF</i> is also greater than the square on <i>FD</i> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <i>CF</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.II.html#4>X.Def.II.4</a></div>
<p>And, if <i>AE</i> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, then <i>CF</i> is also commensurable with it, and each of the straight lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> is a fourth binomial.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.II.html#5>X.Def.II.5</a></div>
<p>But, if <i>EB</i> is so commensurable, then <i>FD</i> is also, and each of the straight lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> is a fifth binomial.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.II.html#6>X.Def.II.6</a></div>
<p>But, if neither of the straight lines <i>AE</i> or <i>EB</i> is so commensurable, then neither of the straight lines <i>CF</i> or <i>FD</i> is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, and each of the straight lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> is a sixth binomial.

<p>Hence a straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is binomial and the same in order.

<p>Therefore, <i>a straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is itself also binomial and the same in order.</i>
