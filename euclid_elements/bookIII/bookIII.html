<dd>If on the diameter of a circle a point is taken which is not the center of the circle, and from
 the point straight lines fall upon the circle, then that is greatest on which passes through the
 center, the remainder of the same diameter is least, and of the rest the nearer to the straight line
 through the center is always greater than the more remote; and only two equal straight lines fall

 circle, one of which is through the center and the others are drawn at random, then, of the straight
 lines which fall on the concave circumference, that through the center is greatest, while of the rest
 the nearer to that through the center is always greater than the more remote, but, of the straight
 lines falling on the convex circumference, that between the point and the diameter is least, while of
 the rest the nearer to the least is always less than the more remote; and only two equal straight
 lines fall on the circle from the point, one on each side of the least.
