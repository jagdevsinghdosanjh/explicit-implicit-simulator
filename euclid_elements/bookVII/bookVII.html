<a name=guide><h2>Guide</h2></a>

Book VII is the first of the three books on number theory.  It begins with the 22 definitions used 
throughout these books.  The important definitions  are those for  unit and number, part and 
multiple, even and odd, prime and relatively prime, proportion, and perfect number.  The topics 
in Book VII are antenaresis and the greatest common divisor, proportions of numbers, relatively
prime numbers and prime numbers, and the least common multiple.

<p>The basic construction for Book VII is <i>antenaresis,</i> also called the <i>Euclidean algorithm,</i>  a kind of reciprocal subtraction.  Beginning with two numbers, the smaller, whichever it is, is repeatedly subtracted from the larger until a single number is left.  This algorithm, studied in propositions <a href=propVII1.html>VII.1</a> through VII.3, results in the greatest common divisor of two or more numbers.  

<p>Propositions <a href=propVII5.html>V.5</a> through V.10 develop properties of fractions, that is,
they study how many parts one number is of another in preparation for ratios and proportions.  

<p>The next group of propositions <a href=propVII11.html>VII.11</a> through VII.19 develop the 
theory of proportions for numbers.
<ul>
<a href=propVII11.html>VII.11</a>.  <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>c</i> : <i>d</i> implies
both equal the ratio <i>a</i> &ndash; <i>c</i> : <i>b</i> &ndash; <i>d.</i>
<br><a href=propVII12.html>VII.12</a>.  <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>c</i> : <i>d</i> implies
both equal the ratio <i>a</i> + <i>c</i> : <i>b</i> + <i>d.</i>
<br><a href=propVII13.html>VII.13</a>.  <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>c</i> : <i>d</i> implies
<i>a</i> : <i>c</i> = <i>b</i> : <i>d.</i>
<br><a href=propVII14.html>VII.14</a>.  <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>d</i> : <i>e</i> and
<i>b</i> : <i>c</i> = <i>e</i> : <i>f</i>&nbsp;
imply <i>a</i> : <i>c</i> = <i>d</i> : <i>f.</i>
<br><a href=propVII17.html>VII.17</a>.  <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>ca</i> : <i>cb.</i>
<br><a href=propVII19.html>VII.19</a>.  <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> = <i>c</i> : <i>d</i> if an only if
<i>ad</i> = <i>bc.</i>
</ul>
<p>Propositions <a href=propVII20.html>VII.20</a> through VII.29 discuss representing ratios in lowest terms as relatively prime numbers and properties of relatively prime numbers.  Properties of prime numbers are presented in propositions <a href=propVII30.html>VII.30</a> through VII.32.  Book VII finishes with least common multiples in propositions <a href=propVII33.html>VII.33</a> through VII.39.

<h4>Postulates for numbers</h4>

Postulates are as necessary for numbers as they are for geometry. Euclid, however, supplies none. Missing postulates occurs as early as proposition <a href="propVII2.html">VII.2</a>.  In its proof, Euclid constructs a decreasing sequence of whole positive numbers, and, apparently, uses a principle to conclude that the sequence must stop, that is, there cannot be an infinite decreasing sequence of numbers.  If that is the principle he uses, then it ought to be stated as a postulate for numbers.

<p>Numbers are so familiar that it hardly occurs to us that the theory of numbers needs axioms, too.  In fact, that field was one of the last to receive a careful scrutiny, and axioms for numbers weren&rsquo;t developed until the late 19th century by Dedekind and others.  By that time foundations for the rest of mathematics were laid upon either geometry or number theory or both, and only geometry had axioms.  About the same time that foundations for number theory were developed, a new subject, set theory, was created by Dedekind and Cantor, and mathematics was refounded in terms of set theory.

<p>The foundations of number theory will be discussed in the Guides to the various definitions and propositions.
