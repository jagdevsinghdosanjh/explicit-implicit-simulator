<p>Here we have the second ability of a straightedge, namely, to extend a given line <i>AB</i> to <i>CD.</i> This postulate does not say how far a line can be extended.  Sometimes it is used so that the extension equals some other line.  Other times it is extended arbitrarily far.

<p>As with the first postulate, it is implicitly assumed in the books on plane geometry that when a line is extended, it remains in the plane of discussion.  The first proposition on solid geometry, proposition <a href=../bookXI/propXI1.html>XI.1</a>, claims that line can&rsquo;t be only partly in a plane.  The central step in the proof of that proposition is to show that a line cannot be extended in two ways, that is, there is only one continuation of a line.  The proof is hardly convincing.  Rather, this postulate should include a clause to that effect.

<h4>Neusis: fitting a line into a diagram</h4>

Other uses of a straightedge can be imagined.  For instance, it might be marked at two points on it, then fit into a diagram so that the two points fall on two lines, perhaps curved.  This operation is an example of &ldquo;neusis&rdquo; or &ldquo;verging&rdquo; where lines are adjusted to fit the diagram.  For instance, Archimedes, who lived in the century after Euclid, used neusis in several constructions in his work <i>On Spirals.</i>  In the <i>Book of Lemmas,</i> attributed by Thabit ibn-Qurra to Archimedes, neusis is used to trisect an angle.

<table cellpadding=5><tr>
<td>Suppose the angle <i>ABC</i> is to be trisected.  Draw a circle <i>DEF</i> with center <i>B</i> and any radius.  Extend <i>CB</i> through <i>D</i> and beyond.  Fit in a line <i>GHE</i> passing through <i>E</i> and a point <i>G</i> on the line <i>CB</i> extended so that a segment (colored green) equal to the radius <i>BD</i> of the circle starts at <i>G</i> and ends at a point <i>H</i> on the circle. (You&rsquo;ll have to move <i>G</i> around until <i>H</i> lands on the circle.)  Draw <i>BH.</i>

<p>With the help of Euclid&rsquo;s propositions here in Book I, we can show that angle <i>EGC</i> is one-third of angle <i>ABC.</i>   Since the lines <i>GH, HB,</i> and <i>BE</i> are equal, therefore the triangles <i>GHB</i> and <i>HBE</i> are isosceles.  Therefore, by <a href=propI5.html>I.5</a>, angle <i>HGB</i> equals <i>HBG,</i> and angle <i>BHE</i> equals angle <i>BEH.</i>  </td>

<p>By <a href=propI32.html>I.32</a>, the exterior angle <i>BHE</i> of triangle <i>GHB</i> equals the sum of the equal angles  <i>HGB</i> and <i>HBG,</i> therefore angle <i>BHE</i> is double angle <i>HGB.</i>  And angle <i>BEH</i> equals <i>BHE,</i> so it is also double angle <i>HGB.</i>

<p>Again by I.32, the exterior angle <i>ABC</i> of triangle <i>BEG</i> is the sum of angles <i>HGB</i> and <i>BEH.</i>  But angle <i>BEH</i> is double angle <i>HGB,</i> therefore angle <i>ABC</i> is triple angle <i>HGB.</i>

<p>Therefore, angle <i>GHB</i> is one-third of angle <i>ABC.</i>  Q.E.D.

<p>The ancient Greek geometers believed that angle trisection required tools beyond those given in Euclid&rsquo;s postulates.  They were right, but it wasn&rsquo;t proved until Wantzel in 1837 proved that a 60&deg;-angle cannot be so trisected using only Euclidean tools.  

<p>Euclid has no postulate for neusis constructions, and since neusis constructions can trisect angles, we conclude from Wantzel&rsquo;s theorem that another postulate is required to justify neusis constructions.
