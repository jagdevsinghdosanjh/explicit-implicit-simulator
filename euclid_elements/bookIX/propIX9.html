<h1>Proposition 9</h1>

<div class="statement">If as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in continued proportion, and the number after the unit is square, then all the rest are also square; and if the number after the unit is cubic, then all the rest are also  cubic.</div>

<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <i>A, B, C, D, E,</i> and <i>F,</i> beginning from a unit and in continued proportion, and let <i>A,</i> the number after the unit, be square.

<p>I say that all the rest are also square.

<div class="just"><a href="propIX8.html">IX.8</a></div>
<p>Now it was proved that <i>B,</i> the third from the unit, is square as are all those which leave out one.

<p>I say that all the rest are also square.

<div class="just"><a href="../bookVIII/propVIII22.html">VIII.22</a></div>
<p>Since <i>A, B,</i> and <i>C</i> are in continued proportion, and <i>A</i> is square, therefore <i>C</i> is also square. Again, since <i>B, C,</i> and <i>D</i> are in continued proportion, and <i>B</i> is square, therefore <i>D</i> is also square.  Similarly we can prove that all the rest are also square.

<p>Next, let <i>A</i> be a cube.

<p>I say that all the rest are also cubes.

<div class="just"><a href="propIX8.html">IX.8</a></div>
<p>Now it was proved that <i>C,</i> the fourth from the unit, is a cube as are all those which leave out two. 

<p>I say that all the rest are also cubic.

<p>Since the unit is to <i>A</i> as <i>A</i> is to <i>B,</i> therefore the unit measures <i>A</i> the same number of times as <i>A</i> measures <i>B.</i> But the unit measures <i>A</i> according to the units in it, therefore <i>A</i> also measures <i>B</i> according to the units in itself, therefore <i>A</i> multiplied by itself makes <i>B.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="propIX3.html">IX.3</a></div>
<p>And <i>A</i> is cubic. But, if cubic number multiplied by itself makes some number, then the product is also a cube,  therefore <i>B</i> is also a cube.

<div class="just"><a href="../bookVIII/propVIII23.html">VIII.23</a></div>
<p>And, since the four numbers <i>A, B, C,</i> and <i>D</i> are in continued proportion, and <i>A</i> is a cube, therefore <i>D</i> also is a cube.

<p>For the same reason <i>E</i> is also a cube, and similarly all the rest are cubes.

<p>Therefore, <i>if as many numbers as we please beginning from a unit are in continued proportion, and the number after the unit is square, then all the rest are also square; and if the number after the unit is cubic, then all the rest are also cubic.</i>

<h2>Guide</h2>

This proposition says that if a number is a square then all its powers are squares, too. Likewise, the powers of cubes are cubes.

<p>The following theorem is a converse of this one.
