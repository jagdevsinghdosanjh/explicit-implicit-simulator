Evidently, what is meant by &ldquo;vertex&rdquo; is the highest point in the figure, or a highest point when many points are equally high.  But to define &ldquo;height&rdquo; in terms of &ldquo;highest point&rdquo; would be a circular definition.  Indeed, this definition only suggests what &ldquo;height&rdquo; might mean without defining it at all.  Still, by the way the term is used in the <i>Elements,</i> we can determine its meaning. The only planar figures where heights are used in the <i>Elements</i> are triangles and parallelograms.

<p>If the figure is a triangle, and one side has been declared the base, then the height is the expected line, the line drawn from the opposite vertex perpendicular to the base.  If the figure is a parallelogram, and one side has been declared the base, then the height may be taken to be a perpendicular from either of the two vertices not on the base.

<p>In the later books on solid geometry, other figures also can have bases and heights such as parallelepipeds, pyramids, prisms, cones, and cylinders.</td>

<p>Different sides of a figure may be selected as the base depending on the application.  In proposition <a href=../bookXI/propXI39.html>XI.39</a> there are two triangular prisms.  A triangle is chosen taken to be the base of one, while the base of the other is a parallelogram.  The height of the first is a perpendicular drawn between two triangular opposite faces, but the height of the other is a perpendicular drawn between the parallelogram taken as the base and the opposite parallelogram.
