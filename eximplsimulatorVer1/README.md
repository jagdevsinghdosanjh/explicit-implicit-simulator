🌗 Explicit–Implicit Simulator
A modular, symbolic learning platform that explores the dance between explicit and implicit numerical methods—where time steps become breath, and stability becomes story.

🔍 What Is This?
This project simulates and visualizes numerical methods for solving differential equations, including:

🌞 Explicit Methods — forward-facing, fast, but fragile

🌑 Implicit Methods — inward-facing, stable, but computationally deep

🌗 Crank-Nicolson & IMEX — hybrid solvers that balance light and shadow

Each method is wrapped in symbolic overlays and lore cards, turning equations into metaphors and simulations into mythic journeys.

🧠 Features
📊 Interactive Streamlit dashboard

🌀 Symbolic lore cards for each method

🔁 Modular architecture for extensibility

🧮 Visual comparison of stability, stiffness, and error

🧬 Breath-based metaphors for time evolution

🧬 Philosophy
This simulator is more than math—it’s a symbolic mirror. Each method reflects a way of knowing:

Explicit: The fire of intuition

Implicit: The water of reflection

Crank-Nicolson: The breath between inhale and exhale

IMEX: The lightning that splits time

Inspired by Euclid, Gurubani, and the elemental cycles of computation.
