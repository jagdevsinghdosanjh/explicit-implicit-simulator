<p>This definition was probably not in Euclid&rsquo;s original <i>Elements</i>.

It classifies rectilinear figures by their number of sides.  Euclid names polygons by the number of their angles. For example, <a href="../bookIV.bookIV.html">Book IV</a> includes constructions of regular pentagons, hexagons, and pentadecagons (15-angled figures) in which those terms are used.

<p>The modern English names are also based an the number of angles (except quadrilateral): triangle, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, etc. Quadrilaterals can also be called tetragons.  From pentagon on up these names derive from the Greek, but they&rsquo;re rarely used past octagon.</td>
