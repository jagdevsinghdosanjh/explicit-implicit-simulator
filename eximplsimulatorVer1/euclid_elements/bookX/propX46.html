<h1>Proposition 46</h1>

<div class="statement">The side of a rational plus a medial area is divided at one point only.</div>

<div class="just"><a href=propX40.html>X.40</a></div>
<p>Let <i>AB</i> be the side of a rational plus a medial area divided at <i>C</i>, so that <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> are incommensurable in square and let the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> be medial, but twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> rational.

<p>I say that <i>AB</i> is not so divided at another point.

<p>If possible, let it be divided at <i>D</i> also, so that <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> are also incommensurable in square and the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> is medial, but twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> rational.

<div class="just"><a href=propX26.html>X.26</a></div>
<p>Since, then, that by which twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> differs from twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> is also that by which the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> differs from the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i>, while twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> exceeds twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> by a rational area, therefore the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> also exceeds the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> by a rational area, though they are medial, which is impossible.

<p>Therefore the side of a rational plus a medial area is not divided at different points, therefore it is divided at one point only.

<p>Therefore, <i>the side of a rational plus a medial area is divided at one point only.</i>
