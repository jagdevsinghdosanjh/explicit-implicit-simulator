<h1>Proposition 27</h1>

<div class="statement">If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another, then the straight lines are parallel to one another.</div>

<p>Let the straight line <i>EF</i> falling on the two straight lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> make the alternate angles <i>AEF</i> and <i>EFD</i> equal to one another.

<p>I say that <i>AB</i> is parallel to <i>CD.</i>

<p>If not, <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> when produced meet either in the direction of <i>B</i> and <i>D</i> or towards <i>A</i> and <i>C.</i>

<p>Let them be produced and meet, in the direction of <i>B</i> and <i>D,</i> at <i>G.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="propI16.html">I.16</a></div>
<p>Then, in the triangle <i>GEF,</i> the exterior angle <i>AEF</i> equals the interior and opposite angle <i>EFG,</i> which is impossible.

<p>Therefore <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> when produced do not meet in the direction of <i>B</i> and <i>D.</i>
<p>Similarly it can be proved that neither do they meet towards <i>A</i> and <i>C.</i>

<div class="just"><a href=defI23.html>I.Def.23</a></div>
<p>But straight lines which do not meet in either direction are parallel.  Therefore <i>AB</i> is parallel to <i>CD.</i>

<p>Therefore <i>if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another, then the straight lines are parallel to one another.</i>

There is implicitly assumed an ambient plane.  The term alternate angles doesn&rsquo;t have a meaning unless the lines all lie in a plane.

<p>Note that Euclid does not consider two other possible ways that the two lines could meet, namely, in the directions <i>A</i> and <i>D</i> or toward <i>B</i> and <i>C.</i>

<h4>About logical converses, contrapositives, and inverses, </h4>

Although this is the first proposition about parallel lines, it does not require the parallel postulate <a href=post5.html>Post.5</a> as an assumption.  This proposition I.27 and the parallel postulate can be made to look more similar if they are reworded (with the help of <a href=propI13.html>I.13</a>).  

<dl>
<p><dt>Proposition 1.27.
<dd>If a straight line falls on two straight lines, then if the alternate angles are equal, then the straight lines do not meet.  
<p><dt>Postulate 5. 
<dd>If a straight line falls on two straight lines, then if the alternate angles are not equal, then the straight lines meet [on a certain side of the line]. 
</dl>

If the remark about the side is dropped, then the conclusions are logical inverses of each other, and the logical inverse of a statement is logically equivalent to the converse.

<p>This little table summarizes the logical relations between similarly looking statements.

<p><center><table cellspacing=5>
<tr><td>Statement</td>
<td>If <i>P</i> then <i>Q.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Converse</td>
<td>If <i>Q</i> then <i>P.</i></td>
<td>Not logically equivalent to the statement.</tr>
<tr><td>Contrapositive &nbsp;</td>
<td>If not <i>Q</i> then not <i>P.</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>Logically equivalent to the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Inverse</td>
<td>If not <i>P</i> then not <i>Q.</i></td>
<td>Logically equivalent to the converse.</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Although the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the statement, Euclid always proves the contrapositive separately using a proof by contradiction and the original statement.  Similarly, the inverse is proved using the converse.  Sometimes all four statements appear in separate propositions as in propositions <a href=../bookX/propX5.html>X.5</a> through X.8.  Other times the four appear as four statements in one proposition as in <a href=../bookX/propX9.html>X.9</a>.  More often than not, however, the contrapositive and inverse make no appearance, and, of course, the converse only appears when it can be proved.

<h4>Use of Proposition 27</h4>

At this point, parallel lines have yet to be constructed.  That occurs in proposition <a href=propI31.html>I.31</a> which uses this proposition to verify that lines constructed there are parallel.  This proposition is also used in the next one and in <a href=propI33.html>I.33</a>.
