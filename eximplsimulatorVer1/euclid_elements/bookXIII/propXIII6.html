<h1>Proposition 6</h1>

<div class="statement">
If a rational straight line is cut in extreme and mean ratio, then each of the segments is the irrational straight line called apotome.</div>

<p>Let <i>AB</i> be a rational straight line cut in extreme and mean ratio at <i>C,</i> and let <i>AC</i> be the greater segment.

<p>I say that each of the straight lines <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> is the irrational straight line called apotome.</td>

<p>Produce <i>BA,</i> and make <i>AD</i> half of <i>BA.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="propXIII1.html">XIII.1</a></div>
<p>Since, then, the straight line <i>AB</i> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, and to the greater segment <i>AC</i> is added <i>AD</i> which is half of <i>AB,</i> therefore the square on <i>CD</i> is five times the square on <i>DA.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookX/propX6.html">X.6</a></div>
<p>Therefore the square on <i>CD</i> has to the square on <i>DA</i> the ratio which a number has to a number, therefore the square on <i>CD</i> is commensurable with the square on <i>DA</i>

<p>But the square on <i>DA</i> is rational, for <i>DA</i> is rational being half of <i>AB</i> which is rational, therefore the square on <i>CD</i> is also rational. Therefore <i>CD</i> is also rational.</td>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookX/propX9.html">X.9</a>

<p>And, since the square on <i>CD</i> has not to the square on <i>DA</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore <i>CD</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>DA.</i>  Therefore <i>CD</i> and <i>DA</i> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.  Therefore <i>AC</i> is an apotome.

<div class="just"><a href="../bookVI/defVI3.html">VI.Def.3</a>,

<p>Again, since <i>AB</i> is cut in extreme and mean ratio, and <i>AC</i> is the greater segment, therefore the rectangle <i>AB</i> by <i>BC</i> equals the square on <i>AC.</i>

<p>Therefore the square on the apotome <i>AC,</i> if applied to the rational straight line <i>AB,</i> produces <i>BC</i> as breadth. But the square on an apotome, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a first apotome,  therefore <i>CB</i> is a first apotome. And <i>CA</i> was also proved to be an apotome.

<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>

This proposition is used after the construction of a dodecahedron in <a href=propXIII17.html>XIII.17</a> to show that the side of a pentagonal face is the irrational straight line called apotome.
