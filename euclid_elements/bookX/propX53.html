<h1>Proposition 53</h1>

<div class="statement">To find the sixth binomial line.</div>

<p>Set out two numbers <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> such that <i>AB</i> does not have to either of them the ratio which a square number has to a square number, and let there also be another number <i>D</i> which is not square and which does not have to either of the numbers <i>BA</i> or <i>AC</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square number.

<p>Set out any rational straight line <i>E</i>, and let it be contrived that <i>D</i> is to <i>AB</i> as the square on <i>E</i> is to the square on <i>FG</i>. Then the square on <i>E</i> is commensurable with the square on <i>FG</i>.  And <i>E</i> is rational, therefore <i>FG</i> is also rational.

<div class="just"><a href=propX9.html>X.9</a></div>
<p>Now, since <i>D</i> does not have to <i>AB</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither does the square on <i>E</i> have to the square on <i>FG</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore <i>E</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>FG</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX6.html#cor>X.6,Cor.</a>
<br><a href=propX6.html>X.6</a></div>
<p>Again, let it be contrived that <i>BA</i> is to <i>AC</i> as the square on <i>FG</i> is to the square on <i>GH</i>. Then the square on <i>FG</i> is commensurable with the square on <i>HG</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX9.html>X.9</a></div>
<p>Therefore the square on <i>HG</i> is rational. Therefore <i>HG</i> is rational. And, since <i>BA</i> does not have to <i>AC</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither does the square on <i>FG</i> have to the square on <i>GH</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore <i>FG</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>GH</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX36.html>X.36</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>FG</i> and <i>GH</i> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. Therefore <i>FH</i> is binomial.

<p>It is next to be proved that it is also a sixth binomial straight line.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV22.html>V.22</a></div>
<p>Since <i>D</i> is to <i>AB</i> as the square on <i>E</i> is to the square on <i>FG</i>, and also <i>BA</i> is to <i>AC</i> as the square on <i>FG</i> is to the square on <i>GH</i>, therefore, <i>ex aequali</i>, <i>D</i> is to <i>AC</i> as the square on <i>E</i> is to the square on <i>GH</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX9.html>X.9</a></div>
<p>But <i>D</i> does not have to <i>AC</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither does the square on <i>E</i> have to the square on <i>GH</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore <i>E</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>GH</i>.

<p>But it was also proved incommensurable with <i>FG</i>, therefore each of the straight lines <i>FG</i> and <i>GH</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>E</i>.

<p>And, since <i>BA</i> is to <i>AC</i> as the square on <i>FG</i> is to the square on <i>GH</i>, therefore the square on <i>FG</i> is greater than the square on <i>GH</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV19.html#cor>V.19,Cor.</a></div>
<p>Let then the sum of the squares on <i>GH</i> and <i>K</i> equal the square on <i>FG</i>.  Then, in conversion, <i>AB</i> is to <i>BC</i> as the square on <i>FG</i> is to the square on <i>K</i>.

<p>But <i>AB</i> does not have to <i>BC</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square number, so that neither does the square on <i>FG</i> have to the square on <i>K</i> the ratio which a square number has to a square number.

<div class="just"><a href=propX9.html>X.9</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>FG</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>A</i>. Therefore the square on <i>FG</i> is greater than the square on <i>GH</i> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <i>FG</i>.

<p>And <i>FG</i> and <i>GH</i> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <i>E</i> set out.

<p>Therefore <i>FH</i> is a sixth binomial straight line.
