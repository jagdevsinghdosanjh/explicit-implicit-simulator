    ### 🧭 What Is This App Really About?
    This simulator is more than math—it’s a symbolic mirror. It helps us understand how change unfolds, how we predict the future, and how we reflect on uncertainty.

    ### 🔍 The Problem It Solves
    Many real-world systems evolve over time. To model them, we use differential equations. But solving these equations requires choosing a method—each with its own philosophy.

    ### 🌞 Explicit vs 🌑 Implicit
    - 🔥 **Explicit**: Fast, intuitive, like guessing tomorrow’s weather from today’s sunshine.
    - 🌊 **Implicit**: Stable, reflective, like moonlight revealing hidden truths.
    - 🌗 **Crank-Nicolson**: A breath between inhale and exhale.
    - ⚡🌑 **IMEX**: Lightning that splits time—handling fast and slow parts separately.

    ### 🌀 Why Symbolism Matters
    Each method is wrapped in a lore card—a poetic overlay that turns equations into metaphors. This helps learners connect emotionally and intuitively with the math.

    ### 🎨 How It Works
    You choose a method, simulate its behavior, and explore its symbolic meaning. Behind the scenes, Python and Streamlit do the math—but the front end tells a story.

    ### 🧬 Who Is This For?
    - Curious learners
    - Educators
    - Philosophers
    - Anyone who wonders how we model change

    ### 🌌 Final Thought
    This app is a bridge—between intuition and rigor, sunlight and moonlight, breath and computation. Welcome to a universe where math becomes myth.
