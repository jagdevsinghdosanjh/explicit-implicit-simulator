<a name=2><p><dt><h4>Definition 2.</h4></a>
<dd>But if the annex is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, and the square on the whole is greater than that on the annex by the square on a straight line commensurable with the whole, let the apotome be called a <i>second apotome.</i>

<a name=3><p><dt><h4>Definition 3.</h4></a>
<dd>But if neither is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, and the square on the whole is greater than the square on the annex by the square on a straight line commensurable with the whole, let the apotome be called a <i>third apotome.</i>

<a name=4><p><dt><h4>Definition 4.</h4></a>
<dd>Again, if the square on the whole is greater than the square on the annex by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the whole, then, if the whole is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, let the apotome be called a <i>fourth apotome</i>;

<a name=5><p><dt><h4>Definition 5.</h4></a>
<dd>If the annex be so commensurable, a <i>fifth</i>;
