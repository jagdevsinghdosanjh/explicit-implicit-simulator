<div class="statement">The center of the sphere is the same as that of the semicircle.</div>

<h2>Guide</h2>

There are alternative definitions for a sphere, but Euclid chose this one, perhaps, to be analogous to the definitions of cone in <a href=defXI18.html>XI.Def.18</a> and cylinder in <a href=defXI21.html>XI.Def.22</a>. These are all defined as <i>solids of revolution,</i> that is, solids generated by rotating a plane figure around a straight line called the <i>axis of revolution.</i>

<p>Another book would probably be required to develop the theory of spheres to the degree that Euclid developed the theory of circles in Book III, but that, apparently, was not his goal.  The lack of propositions is so severe that it is not even shown that any two points on the surface of a sphere are equidistant from the center.  (Any point on the surface of the sphere is a point on
the circumference of one of the rotated semicircles, and all the points on any of these semicircles are equidistant from the center of the semicircles.)

<tr><td>In the illustration at the right there is a semicircle <i>ADB</i> with center <i>C</i> and diameter <i>AB</i> in a plane.  When the semicircle is revolved around <i>AB,</i> a sphere results.  The sphere&rsquo;s axis is <i>AB,</i> and its center is <i>C.</i>  If <i>E</i> is any point on the sphere and <i>F</i> the antipodal point, then the line <i>EF</i> is a diameter of the sphere.

<p>There are very few propositions about spheres in the <i>Elements.</i>  Proposition <a href=../bookXII/propXII17.html>XII.17</a> allows a kind of approximation of spheres by polyhedra preliminary to proposition <a href=../bookXII/propXII18.html>XII.18</a> on the ratio of volumes of spheres.  Also, regular polyhedra are inscribed in spheres in <a href=../bookXIII/bookXIII.html>Book XIII</a>

<p>With so few propositions there are gaps in the proofs.  For instance, in XII.17 it is claimed that the the intersection of a plane and a sphere is a circle, but a justification is lacking.
