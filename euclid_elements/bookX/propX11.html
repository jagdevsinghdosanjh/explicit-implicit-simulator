<h1>Proposition 11</h1>

<div class="statement">If four magnitudes are proportional, and the first is commensurable with the second, then the third also is commensurable with the fourth; but, if the first is incommensurable with the second, then the third also is incommensurable with the fourth.</div>

<p>Let <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>D</i> be four magnitudes in proportion, so that <i>A</i> is to <i>B</i> as <i>C</i> is to <i>D</i>, and let <i>A</i> be commensurable with <i>B</i>.

<p>I say that <i>C</i> is also commensurable with <i>D</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX5.html>X.5</a></div>
<p>Since <i>A</i> is commensurable with <i>B</i>, therefore <i>A</i> has to <i>B</i> the ratio which a number has to a number.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV11.html>V.11</a>
<br><a href=propX6.html>X.6</a></div>
<p>And <i>A</i> is to <i>B</i> as <i>C</i> is to <i>D</i>, therefore <i>C</i> also has to <i>D</i> the ratio which a number has to a number.  Therefore <i>C</i> is commensurable with <i>D</i>.

<p>Next, let <i>A</i> be incommensurable with <i>B</i>.

<p>I say that <i>C</i> is also incommensurable with <i>D</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX7.html>X.7</a></div>
<p>Since <i>A</i> is incommensurable with <i>B</i>, therefore <i>A</i> does not have to <i>B</i> the ratio which a number has to a number.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV11.html>V.11</a>,
<a href=propX8.html>X.8</a></div>
<p>And <i>A</i> is to <i>B</i> as <i>C</i> is to <i>D</i>, therefore neither has <i>C</i> to <i>D</i> the ratio which a number has to a number. Therefore <i>C</i> is incommensurable with <i>D</i>.

<p>Therefore, <i>if four magnitudes are proportional, and the first is commensurable with the second, then the third also is commensurable with the fourth; but, if the first is incommensurable with the second, then the third also is incommensurable with the fourth.</i>

<div class="qed">Q.E.D.</div>

<a name=guide><h2>Guide</h2></a>

The proof if very direct.  If <i>A</i>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<i>B</i> = <i>C</i>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<i>D</i>, and the first ratio equals a numeric ratio, then the second equals that, too, but if the first is not a numeric ratio, then neither is the second.

<p>This proposition is used in repeatedly in Book X starting with <a href=propX14.html>X.14</a>.  It is also used in the previous proposition which was, no doubt, not in the original <i>Elements</i>.
