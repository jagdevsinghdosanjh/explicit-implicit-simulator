<td>In the definition of right angle, it is clear that the two angles at the foot of a perpendicular, such as angles <i>ACD</i> and <i>BCD,</i> are equal.  This postulate says that an angle at the foot of one perpendicular, such as angle <i>ACD,</i> equals an angle at the foot of any other perpendicular, such as angle <i>EGH.</i>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This postulate forms the basis of angle measurement.  The only angle measurement that occurs in the <i>Elements</i> is in terms of right angles.  For instance, in proposition <a href=propI17.html>I.17</a> the sum of two angles is shown to be less than two right angles.  Another example is in the proof of proposition <a href=../bookII/propII9.html>II.9</a> in which two angles are shown to each be half of a right angle, so they are equal. Also, in proposition <a href="../bookIII/propIII.16.html">III.16</a> this postulate is used to claim that two angles cannot sum to less than two right angles yet be equal to two other right angles.
 

<p>This postulate is first explicitly used in proposition <a href=propI14.html>I.14</a>.
