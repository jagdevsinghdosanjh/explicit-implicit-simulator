<h2>Guide: On Propositions I.4 through I.8</h2></center>

This next group of propositions includes two congruence propositions for triangles, I.4 and I.8, and two propositions about isosceles triangles, I.5 and I.6.  Proposition I.7 is only used in I.8 and could have been made part of I.8, but was probably separated in order to reduce the length of the proof in I.8.

<p><h4>Proposition I.4</h4>
<ul><i>If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides respectively, and have the angles contained by the equal straight lines equal, then they also have the base equal to the base, the triangle equals the triangle, and the remaining angles  equal the remaining angles respectively, namely those opposite the equal sides.</i></ul>

This is the familiar side-angle-side congruence proposition for triangles.  When two triangles  have two sides and the included angle equal, then the remaining sides, angle, and area are also equal, that is to say, they&rsquo;re congruent.  Symbolically, given triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>DEF</i> with <i>AB</i> = <i>DE</i>,  <i>AC</i> = <i>DF</i>, and angle <i>BAC</i> = angle <i>EDF</i>, then the rest of the parts of the triangles are the same.

<p>Euclid&rsquo;s proof of this proposition relies on the "principle of superposition".  This principle is not supported by his postulates, and so it would be more appropriate to take <a href=propI4.html target=elements>I.4</a> as a postulate than pretend that it is adequately justified by its proof.  For more discussion on this point, see the <a href=propI4.html#guide target=elements>Guide</a> for I.4.

<p>There will be two other congruence propositions: <a href=propI8.html target=elements>I.8</a>, side-side-side, and <a href=propI26.html target=elements>I.26</a>, side and two angles.

<p><h4>Proposition I.5</h4>
<ul><i>In isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another.</i></ul>

An <i>isosceles</i> triangle is defined in <a href=defI20.html target=elements>I.Def.20</a> as a triangle with two equal sides.

In the figure <i>AB</i> = <i>AC</i>, so triangle <i>ABC</i> is isosceles.
One of the properties of such triangles is that they also have two equal angles, the base angles of the triangle, angles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ACB</i>. that&rsquo;s the first part of the statement of Proposition <a href=propI5.html target=elements>I.5</a>.  The other conclusion is that the angles supplementary to the base angles are also equal, that is, angles <i>DBC</i> and <i>ECB</i> are equal.
