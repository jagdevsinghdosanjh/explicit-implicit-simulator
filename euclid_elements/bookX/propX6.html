<h1>Proposition 6</h1>

<div class="statement">If two magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number, then the magnitudes are commensurable.</div>

<p>Let the two magnitudes <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> have to one another the ratio which the number <i>D</i> has to the number <i>E</i>.

<p>I say that the magnitudes <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are commensurable.

<p>Divide <i>A</i> into as many equal parts as there are units in <i>D</i>, and let <i>C</i> equal one of them, and let <i>F</i> be made up of as many magnitudes equal to <i>C</i> as there are units in <i>E</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookVII/defVII20.html>VII.Def.20</a></div>
<p>Since then there are in <i>A</i> as many magnitudes equal to <i>C</i> as there are units in <i>D</i>, whatever part the unit is of <i>D</i>, the same part is <i>C</i> of <i>A</i> also. Therefore <i>C</i> is to <i>A</i> as the unit is to <i>D</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV7.html#cor>V.7,Cor.</a></div>
<p>But the unit measures the number <i>D</i>, therefore <i>C</i> also measures <i>A</i>.  And since <i>C</i> is to <i>A</i> as the unit is to <i>D</i>, therefore, inversely, <i>A</i> is to <i>C</i> as the number <i>D</i> is to the unit.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookVII/defVII20.html>VII.Def.20</a></div>
<p>Again, since there are in <i>F</i> as many magnitudes equal to <i>C</i> as there are units in <i>E</i>, therefore <i>C</i> is to <i>F</i> as the unit is to <i>E</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV22.html>V.22</a></div>
<p>But it was also proved that <i>A</i> is to <i>C</i> as <i>D</i> is to the unit, therefore, <i>ex aequali</i>, <i>A</i> is to <i>F</i> as <i>D</i> is to <i>E</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV11.html>V.11</a></div>
<p>But <i>D</i> is to <i>E</i> as <i>A</i> is to <i>B</i>, therefore <i>A</i> is to <i>B</i> as it is to <i>F</i> also.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV9.html>V.9</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>A</i> has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes <i>B</i> and <i>F</i>. Therefore <i>B</i> equals <i>F</i>.

<p>But <i>C</i> measures <i>F</i>, therefore it measures <i>B</i> also. Further it measures <i>A</i> also, therefore <i>C</i> measures <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.I.html>X.Def.1</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>A</i> is commensurable with <i>B</i>.

<p>Therefore, <i>if two magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number, then the magnitudes are commensurable.</i>

<h1>Corollary</h1>

<div class="just"><a href=../bookVI/propVI9.html>VI.9</a></div>
<p>From this it is clear that, <i>if there are two numbers as <i>D</i> and <i>E</i>, and a straight line as <i>A</i>, then it is possible to make a straight line <i>F</i> such that the given straight line is to it as the number <i>D</i> is to the number <i>E</i>.</i>

<div class="just"><a href=../bookVI/propVI19.html#cor>VI.19,Cor.</a></div>
<p>And <i>if a mean proportional is also taken between <i>A</i> and <i>F</i>, as <i>B</i>, then <i>A</i> is to <i>F</i> as the square on <i>A</i> is to the square on <i>B</i>, that is, the first is to the third as the figure on the first is to that which is similar and similarly described on the second.</i>

<p>But <i>A</i> is to <i>F</i> as the number <i>D</i> is to the number <i>E</i>, therefore the number <i>D</i> is to the number <i>E</i> as the figure on the straight line <i>A</i> is to the figure on the straight line <i>B</i>.

<div class="qed">Q.E.D.</div>
</div>

<a name=guide><h2>Guide</h2></a>

<p>If <i>A</i>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<i>B</i> = <i>m</i>&nbsp;:&nbsp;<i>n</i>, then, with <i>C</i> equal to <i>A/m</i>, it follows that <i>A</i> = <i>mC</i> and <i>B</i> = <i>nC</i>.

<p>The proof assumes that magnitudes are divisible.  Not all magnitudes, however, are constructively divisible.  For instance, a 60&deg; angle cannot be trisected by a Euclidean construction.  An alternate proof which does not depend on divisibility of magnitudes can be based on antenaresis.

<p>Although the proposition refers to magnitudes of any kind, the corollary only applies to lines in the first statement and plane figures in the second.

<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>

The proposition is used in very frequently in Book X starting with the next proposition, its contrapositive.  It is also used in proposition <a href=../bookXIII/propXIII6.html>XIII.6</a>.
The corollary is also used frequently in Book X starting with <a href=propX10.html>X.10</a>.
