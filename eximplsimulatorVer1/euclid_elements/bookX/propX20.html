<h1>Proposition 20</h1>

<div class="statement">If a rational area is applied to a rational straight line, then it produces as breadth a straight line rational and commensurable in length with the straight line to which it is applied.</div>

<p>Let the rational area <i>AC</i> be applied to <i>AB</i>, a straight line once more rational in any of the aforesaid ways, producing <i>BC</i> as breadth.

<p>I say that <i>BC</i> is rational and commensurable in length with <i>BA</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookI/propI46.html>I.46</a>,
<a href=defX.I.html#4>X.Def.I.4</a></div>
<p>Describe the square <i>AD</i> on <i>AB</i>.  Then <i>AD</i> is rational.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookVI/propVI1.html>VI.1</a>
<br><a href=propX11.html>X.11</a></div>
<p>But <i>AC</i> is also rational, therefore <i>DA</i> is commensurable with <i>AC</i>. And <i>DA</i> is to <i>AC</i> as <i>DB</i> is to <i>BC</i>. Therefore <i>DB</i> is also commensurable with <i>BC</i>, and <i>DB</i> equals <i>BA</i>.  Therefore <i>AB</i> is also commensurable with <i>BC</i>.

<p>But <i>AB</i> is rational, <i>C</i> therefore <i>BC</i> is also rational and commensurable in length with <i>AB</i>.

<p>Therefore, <i>if a rational area is applied to a rational straight line, then it produces as breadth a straight line rational and commensurable in length with the straight line to which it is applied.</i>

<p>This proposition is a converse of the last, except that it&rsquo;s preceded by applying an area to a straight line to get the rectangle.  That would be more evident if it read &ldquo;If one side of a rational rectangle is rational, then the other side is rational and commensurable with the first.&rdquo;

<p>It&rsquo;s often easier to understand the statement and proof they&rsquo;re translated into modern language.  Let <i>a</i> be the length of <i>AB</i>, and <i>b</i> be the length of <i>BC</i>. Since the rectangle <i>AC</i> is rational, that means its area <i>ab</i> is a rational number.  Since <i>AB</i> is a rational line, that means <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> is a rational number.  Therefore, <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> is a rational number, that is, lines <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are commensurable.  Also, <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> is a rational number, that is, line <i>BC</i> is a rational line.

<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>

<p>This proposition is used frequently in Book X starting with <a href=propX26.html>X.26</a>.
