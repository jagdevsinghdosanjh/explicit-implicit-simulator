<h1>Proposition 5</h1>

<div class="statement">
In equal triangles which have one angle equal to one angle the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, are equal.
</div>

<p>Let <i>ABC</i> and <i>ADE</i> be equal triangles having one angle equal to one angle, namely the angle <i>BAC</i> equal to the angle <i>DAE.</i>

<p>I say that in the triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ADE</i> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to say, that <i>CA</i> is to <i>AD</i> as <i>EA</i> is to <i>AB.</i>

<p>Place them so that <i>CA</i> is in a straight line with <i>AD.</i> Therefore <i>EA</i> is also in a straight line with <i>AB.</i>

<p>Join <i>BD.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV7.html">V.7</a></div>
<p>Since then the triangle <i>ABC</i> equals the triangle <i>ADE,</i> and <i>ABD</i> is another triangle, therefore the triangle <I>ABC</I> is to the triangle <i>ABD</i> as the triangle <i>ADE</i> is to the triangle <i>ABD.</i>

<div class="just"><a href=propVI1.html>VI.1</a></div>
<p>But <i>ABC</i> is to <i>ABD</i> as <i>AC</i> is to <i>AD,</i>  and <i>ADE</i> is to <i>ABD</i> as <i>AE</i> is to <i>AB.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV11.html">V.11</a></div>
<p>Therefore also <i>AC</i> is to <i>AD</i> as <i>AE</i> is to <i>AB.</i>

<p>Therefore in the triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ADE</i> the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.

<p>Next, let the sides of the triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ADE</i> be reciprocally proportional, that is to say, let <i>AE</i> be to <i>AB</i> as <i>CA</i> is to <i>AD.</i>

<p>I say that the triangle <i>ABC</i> equals the triangle <i>ADE.</i>

<div class="just"><a href=propVI1.html>VI.1</a>
<br><a href="../bookV/propV11.html">V.11</a></div>
<p>If <i>BD</i> is again joined, since <i>AC</i> is to <i>AD</i> as <i>AE</i> is to <i>AB,</i> while <i>AC</i> is to <i>AD</i> as the triangle <i>ABC</i> is to the triangle <i>ABD,</i> and <i>AE</i> is to <i>AB</i> as the triangle <i>ADE</i> is to the triangle <i>ABD,</i> therefore the triangle <i>ABC</i> is to the triangle <i>ABD</i> as the triangle <i>ADE</i> is to the triangle <i>ABD.</i>

<p>Therefore each of the triangles <i>ABC</i> and <i>ADE</i> has the same ratio to <i>ABD.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookV/propV9.html">V.9</a></div>
<p>Therefore the triangle <i>ABC</i> equals the triangle <i>ADE.</i>

<p>Therefore, <i>in equal triangles which have one angle equal to one angle the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and those triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, and in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, are equal.</i>
