<h1>Proposition 45</h1>

<div class="statement">A major straight line is divided at one point only.</div>

<p>Let <i>AB</i> be a major straight line divided at <i>C</i>, so that <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> are incommensurable in square, and let the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> be rational, but the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> medial.

<p>I say that <i>AB</i> is not so divided at another point.

<p>If possible, let it also be divided at <i>D</i>, so that <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> are incommensurable in square and the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> is rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial.

<div class="just"><a href=propX26.html>X.26</a></div>
<p>Then, since that by which the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> differs from the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> is also that by which twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> differs from twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i>, while the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> exceeds the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> by a rational area, for both are rational, therefore twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> also exceeds twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> by a rational area, though they are medial, which is impossible.

<p>Therefore a major straight line is not divided at different points.  Therefore it is only divided at one and the same point.

<p>Therefore, <i>a major straight line is divided at one point only.</i>
