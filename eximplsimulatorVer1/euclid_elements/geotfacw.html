<center><h1>A review of <i>Geometry: tools for a changing world</i></H1> </center>

<p><i>Geometry: tools for a changing world</i> by Laurie E. Bass, Basia Rinesmith Hall, Art Johnson,
 and Dorothy F. Wood, with contributing author Simone W. Bess, published by Prentice-Hall, 1998.

<p>This textbook is on the list of accepted books for the states of Texas and New Hampshire.  
<div class="just"> a
 glitzy book filled with pictures to keep the attention of the students.  that&rsquo;s fine.  
<div class="just"> the
 content that bothers me, in particular, the lack of logical content.

<p><b>Chapter 1</b> introduces postulates on page 14 as accepted statements of facts.  The four
 postulates stated there involve points, lines, and planes.  Unfortunately, the first two are
 redundant.  Postulate 1-1 says 'through any two points there is exactly one line,' and postulate 1-2
 says 'if two lines intersect, then they intersect in exactly one point.'  The second one should not
 be a postulate, but a theorem, since it easily follows from the first.  And what better time to
 introduce logic than at the beginning of the course.  No statement should be taken as a postulate
 when it can be proved, especially when it can be easily proved.

<p>A number of definitions are also given in the first chapter.  Later postulates deal with distance
 on a line, lengths of line segments, and angles.  

<p>The book does not properly treat constructions.  Constructions can be either postulates or
 theorems, depending on whether they&rsquo;re assumed or proved.  For instance, postulate 1-1 above is
 actually a construction.  On pages 40 through 42 four constructions are given: 1) to cut a line
 segment equal to a given line segment, 2) to construct an angle equal to a given angle, 3) to
 construct a perpendicular bisector of a line segment, and 4) to bisect an angle.  Later in the book,
 these constructions are used to prove theorems, yet they are not proved here, nor are they proved
 later in the book.  There is no indication whether they are to be taken as postulates (they should
 not, since they can be proved), or as theorems.  At the very least, it should be stated that they are
 theorems which will be proved later.

<p>Next, the concept of theorem is given: a statement with a proof, where a proof is a convincing
 argument that uses deductive reasoning.  The theorem "vertical angles are congruent" is given with a
 proof. It is followed by a two more theorems either supplied with proofs or left as exercises.

<p>Also in chapter 1 there is an introduction to plane coordinate geometry.  Unfortunately, there is
 no connection made with plane synthetic geometry.  Here in chapter 1, a distance formula is asserted
 with neither logical nor intuitive justification.  Of course, the justification is the Pythagorean
 theorem, and that&rsquo;s not discussed until chapter 5.  In that chapter there is an exercise to prove the
 distance formula from the Pythagorean theorem.  The Pythagorean theorem itself gets proved in yet a
 later chapter.

<p>In summary, the constructions should be postponed until they can be justified, and then they should
 be justified.  The same for coordinate geometry.

<p><b>Chapter 2</b> begins with theorem that the internal angles of a triangle sum to 180&deg;.  The
 proof is postponed until an exercise in chapter 7, and is based on two postulates on parallels.
 (Chapter 7 suffers from unnecessary postulates.)  Other theorems that follow from the angle sum
 theorem are given as exercises to prove with outlines.

<p>In a return to coordinate geometry it is implicitly assumed that a linear equation is the equation
 of a straight line.  A proof would depend on the theory of similar triangles in chapter 10.  At this
 point it is suggested that one can conclude that parallel lines have equal slope, and that the
 product the slopes of perpendicular lines is -1.  The only justification given is by experiment.  (A
 proof would require the theory of parallels.) What's worse is what comes next on the page 85:

<ul>10. If line <i>k</i> || line <i>l</i> and line <i>r</i> || line <i>l</i>, what is the relationship
 between lines <i>k</i> and <i>r</i>?

<p>11. If line <i>t</i> is perpendicular to line <i>k</i> and line <i>s</i> is perpendicular to line
 <i>k</i>, what is the relationship between lines <i>t</i> and <i>s</i>?

<p>Questions 10 and 11 demonstrate the following theorems.

<p>Theorem 2-5.  Two lines parallel to a third line are parallel to each other.
<p>Theorem 2-6.  In a plane, two lines perpendicular to a third line are parallel to each other.
</ul>

Questions 10 and 11 do not demonstrate the following theorems.  The students are not asked to prove 10
 and 11, and even if they were, they would depend on the unproven statements about coordinate geometry
 slopes of lines.  Thus, we have two purported theorems totally without justification.  A proper
 justification can only be given after chapter 10.

<p>(And this occurs in the section in which 'conjecture' is discussed. "Test your conjecture by
 graphing several equations of lines where the values of <i>m</i> are the same." What's the proper
 conclusion? That theorems may be justified by looking at a few examples?)

<p>In summary, the material in chapter 2 should be postponed until after elementary geometry is
 developed.

<p><b>Chapter 3</b> is about isometries of the plane.  The entire chapter is entirely devoid of logic.
  How are the theorems proved?  "The Work Together illustrates the two properties summarized in the
 theorems below.  Theorem 3-1: A composition of reflections in two parallel lines is a translation.
 ..."  Moving a bunch of paper figures around in a "work together" does not constitute a justification
 of a theorem.

<p>The theorems can be proven once a little actual geometry is presented, but that&rsquo;s not done until
 the last half of the book.  A little honesty is needed here.  Why not tell them that the proofs will
 be postponed until a later chapter?  Or that we just don&rsquo;t have time to do the proofs for this
 chapter.  Even better: don&rsquo;t label statements as theorems (like many other unproved statements in the
 chapter).  Like the theorems in chapter 2, those in chapter 3 cannot be proved until after elementary
 geometry is developed.

<p>In summary, either this chapter should be inserted in the proper place in the course, or else
 tossed out entirely.  Since there&rsquo;s a lot to learn in geometry, it would be best to toss it out.

<p><b>Chapter 4</b> begins the study of triangles.  The first theorem states that base angles of an
 isosceles triangle are equal.  But the proof doesn&rsquo;t occur until chapter 8.  
<div class="just"> getting a bit much.
  Almost every proof is being omitted or postponed until several chapters later.  And when the proofs
 do come, they depend on constructions that were never justified.  For instance, this first theorem is
 proved in chapter 8 using an angle bisector, but the construction for an angle bisector (chap.1) is
 given without justification.

<p>The proofs of the next two theorems are postponed until chapter 8.  The next four theorems which
 only involve addition and subtraction of angles appear with their proofs (which depend on the angle
 sum of a triangle whose proof doesn&rsquo;t occur until chapter 7).

<p>Another theorem in this chapter states that the line joining the midpoints of two sides of a
 triangle is parallel to the third and half its length.  A coordinate proof is given, but as the
 properties of coordinates are never proved, the proof is unsatisfactory.  An actual proof can be
 given, but not until the basic properties of triangles and parallels are proven.

<p>The text again shows contempt for logic in the section on triangle inequalities.  In a silly "work
 together" students try to form triangles out of various length straws.  Rather than try to figure out
 the relations between the sides of a triangle for themselves, they&rsquo;re led by the nose to "conjecture
 about the sum of the lengths of two sides of a triangle compared to the length of the third side.
 Think and discuss.  Triangle Inequality Theorem.  Your observations from the Work Together suggest
 the following theorem," and the statement of the theorem follows.  Honesty out the window.  Can any
 student armed with this book prove this theorem? Can a teacher? Can the authors?  Is it possible to
 prove it without using the postulates of chapter eight?  No.  What is this theorem doing here?

<p>The next two theorems depend on that one, and their proofs are either given or left as exercises,
 but the following four are not proved in any way.  Theorem 4-12 says a point on a perpendicular
 bisector is equidistant from the ends, and the next theorem is its converse.  What's the
 justification?  Draw the figure and measure the lines.  that&rsquo;s no justification.  But 
<div class="just"> easy to
 prove.  All you need is a little basic geometry.  Here we are on page 219 of a 633-page book
 (excluding the appendices and index), and, still, the students haven&rsquo;t seen the basics of geometry!

<p>For the 19 theorems in chapter 4, three proofs are postponed until a later chapter; two proofs are
 given but depend on results in later chapters; two proofs are validly given or left as exercises; one
 is given with a coordinate proof (and therefore, ultimately unproved); one cannot be proved until a
 later chapter, and the next two depend on it; four more proofs are not given but would depend on
 results in later chapters, and the next two given proofs depend on them; and the last two proofs are
 not given (but would depend on later results).

<p>In summary, chapter 4 is a dismal chapter.  
<div class="just"> a prime example of what should never be done in a
 mathematics book.  It shows no respect for logic, and unproved and proved theorems are not
 distinguished.  ("Unproved theorem" is an oxymoron.  If 
<div class="just"> not proved, then 
<div class="just"> not a theorem.)
 But the material is important and should be treated with respect.  It should all be postponed (except
 the theorems on right angles) until after the basic theory of triangles and parallels is developed.

<p><b>Chapter 5</b> is about areas, including the Pythagorean theorem.  It begins with postulates
 about area: the area of a square is the square of the length of its side, congruent figures have
 equal area, and the area of a region is the sum of the areas of its nonoverlapping parts. A theorem
 follows: the area of a rectangle is the product of its base and height.  There is no proof given, not
 even a "work together" piecing together squares to make the rectangle.  An actual proof is difficult.
  It would depend either on limiting processes (which are inappropriate at this level), or the
 construction of a square equal to a rectangle (which could be done much later in the text).  It would
 be just as well to make this theorem a postulate and drop the first postulate about a square.

<p>The next two theorems about areas of parallelograms and triangles come with proofs.  Then come the
 Pythagorean theorem and its converse.  In a "work together" students try to piece together triangles
 and a square to come up with the ancient Chinese proof of the theorem.  "The Work Together presents a
 justification of the well-known right triangle relationship called the Pythagorean Theorem."  At this
 time, however, 
<div class="just"> not a complete proof since the theory of parallels has not been done; the
 existence of any square requires the parallel postulate.  Garfield's proof of the Pythagorean theorem
 is offered in chapter 5, and other proofs later, but all depend on the theory of parallels discussed
 in chapter 7.  The converse is apparently not proved anywhere in the book.

<p>Next 45&deg;-45&deg;-90&deg; and 30&deg;-60&deg;-90&deg; triangles are solved, and areas of
 trapezoids and regular polygons are found.

<p>The tenth theorem in the chapter claims the circumference of a circle is pi times the diameter.  It
 is apparent (but not explicit) that pi is defined in this theorem as the ratio of circumference of a
 circle to its diameter.  So the content of the theorem is that all circles have the same ratio of
 circumference to diameter.  This theorem is not proven.  It would require the basic geometry that
 won&rsquo;t come for a couple of chapters yet, and it would require a definition of length of a curve and
 limiting processes.  It would be nice if a statement were included that the proof the the theorem is
 beyond the scope of the course.

<p>Theorem 5-12 states that the area of a circle is pi times the square of the radius.  A "work
 together" has students cutting pie-shaped pieces from a circle and arranging them alternately to form
 a rough rectangle.  That idea is the best justification that can be given without using advanced
 techniques.

<p>In summary, chapter 5 could be fairly good, but it should be postponed until after the Pythagorean
 theorem can be proved.

<p><b>Chapter 6</b> is on surface areas and volumes of solids.  It is strange that surface areas and
 volumes are treated while the basics of solid geometry are ignored.

<p>There are 11 theorems, the only ones that can be proved without advanced mathematics are the ones
 on the surface area of a right prism (box) and a regular pyramid. Most of the theorems are given with
 little or no justification.  The area of a cylinder is justified by unrolling it; the area of a cone
 is unjustified; Cavalieri's principle is stated as a theorem but not proved (it can't be proved
 without advanced mathematics, better to make it a postulate); the volumes of prisms and cylinders are
 found using Cavalieri's principle; and the volumes of pyramids and cones are stated without
 justification.  The only argument for the surface area of a sphere involves wrapping yarn around a
 ball, and that&rsquo;s unlikely to get within 10% of the formula.  Finally, a limiting argument is given
 for the volume of a sphere, which is the best that can be done at this level.

<p>In summary, there is little mathematics in chapter 6.  Most of the results require more than what's
 possible in a first course in geometry.  Surface areas and volumes should only be treated after the
 basics of solid geometry are covered.  Alternatively, surface areas and volumes may be  left as an
 application of calculus.

<p><b>Chapter 7</b> is on the theory of parallel lines.  It begins by postulating that corresponding
 angles made by a transversal cutting two parallel lines are equal.  One postulate is enough, but for
 some reason two others are also given: the converse to the first postulate, and Euclid&rsquo;s parallel
 postulate (actually Playfair's postulate).  A proliferation of unnecessary postulates is not a good
 thing.  One postulate should be selected, and the others made into theorems.

<p>Four theorems follow, each being proved or left as exercises.  Then there are three constructions
 for parallel and perpendicular lines.  Proofs of the constructions are given or left as exercises.
 But the constructions depend on earlier constructions which still have not been proved, and cannot be
 proved until the basic theory of triangles is developed in the next chapter.

<p>In summary, postpone the presentation of parallel lines until after chapter 8, and select only one
 postulate for parallel lines.

<p><b>Chapter 8</b> finally begins the basic theory of triangles at page 406, almost two-thirds of the
 way through the book.  This chapter suffers from one of the same problems as the last, namely, too
 many postulates.  The three congruence theorems for triangles, SSS, SAS, and ASA, are <i>all</i>
 taken as postulates.  One is enough. The other two should be theorems. 

<p>There are only two theorems in this very important chapter.  There&rsquo;s a trivial proof of AAS (by now
 the internal angle sum of a triangle has been demonstrated).  Then the Hypotenuse-Leg congruence
 theorem for right triangles is proved.  Some of the theorems of earlier chapters are finally proved,
 but the original constructions of chapter 1 aren&rsquo;t.

<p>In summary, this should be chapter 1, not chapter 8.  Results in all the earlier chapters depend on
 it. The book is backwards.  How did geometry ever become taught in such a backward way?  Done right,
 the material in chapters 8 and 7 and the theorems in the earlier chapters that depend on it, should
 form the bulk of the course.  Much more emphasis should be placed here.

<p><b>Chapter 9</b> is on parallelograms and other quadrilaterals.  Nearly every theorem is proved or
 left as an exercise.  By this time the students should be doing their own proofs with bare hints or
 none at all, but several of the exercises have almost complete outlines for proofs.  Only one theorem
 has no proof (base angles of isosceles trapezoids, and one is given by way of coordinates.

<p>Too much is included in this chapter.  The sections on rhombuses, trapezoids, and kites are not
 important and should be omitted.  

<p><b>Chapter 10</b> is on similarity and similar figures.  (Appropriately for this level, the
 difficulties of proportions are buried in the implicit assumptions of real numbers.)  One postulate
 is taken: triangles with equal angles are similar (meaning proportional sides).  The first five
 theorems are are accompanied by proofs or left as exercises.  The proofs are omitted for the theorems
 which say similar plane figures have areas in duplicate ratios, and similar solid figures have areas
 in duplicate ratios and volumes in triplicate rations.  At least there should be a proof that similar
 triangles have areas in duplicate ratios; that&rsquo;s easy since the areas of triangles are already known.

<p><b>Chapter 11</b> covers right-triangle trigonometry.  
<div class="just"> hard to see how there&rsquo;s any time left
 for trigonometry in a course on geometry, but at least it should be possible to prove the basic facts
 of trigonometry once the theory of similar triangles is done.  The section of angles of elevation and
 depression need not appear, and the section of vectors omitted.  (By the way, who ever calls the sum
 of two vectors the "resultant" of the two vectors?)  The one theorem of the chapter (area of triangle
 = 1/2 bc sin A) is given for acute triangles.

<p>As the trig functions for obtuse angles aren&rsquo;t covered, and applications of trig to non-right
 triangles aren&rsquo;t mentioned, it would probably be better to remove this chapter entirely.

<p><b>Chapter 12</b> discusses some geometry of the circle, in particular, properties of radii,
 chords, secants, and tangents.

<p>There are 16 theorems, some with proofs, some left to the students, some proofs omitted.  This is
 one of the better chapters in the book.



<p>
<p><b>Final conclusion.</b>  Much more emphasis should be placed on the logical structure of geometry.
  Postulates should be carefully selected, and clearly distinguished from theorems.  Every theorem
 should be proved, or left as an exercise, or noted as having a proof beyond the scope of the course.
 Very few theorems, or none at all, should be stated with proofs forthcoming in future chapters. 

<p>It should be emphasized that "work togethers" do not substitute for proofs.  They can lead to an
 understanding of the statement of the theorem, but few of them lead to proofs of the theorem.  It
 must be emphasized that examples do not justify a theorem.
