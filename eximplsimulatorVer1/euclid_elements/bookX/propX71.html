<h1>Proposition 71</h1>

<div class="statement">If a rational and a medial are added together, then four irrational straight lines arise, namely a binomial or a first bimedial or a major or a side of a rational plus a medial area.</div>

<p>Let <i>AB</i> be rational, and <i>CD</i> medial.

<p>I say that the side of the area <i>AD</i> is a binomial or a first bimedial or a major or a side of a rational plus a medial area.

<p>For <i>AB</i> is either greater or less than <i>CD</i>.

<p>First, let it be greater.  Set out a rational straight line <i>EF</i> , apply to <i>EF</i> the rectangle <i>EG</i> equal to <i>AB</i>, producing <i>EH</i> as breadth, and apply to <i>EF</i> <i>HI</i>, equal to <i>DC</i>, producing <i>HK</i> as breadth.

<div class="just"><a href=propX20.html>X.20</a></div>
<p>Then, since <i>AB</i> is rational and equals <i>EG</i>, therefore <i>EG</i> is also rational. And it is applied to <i>EF</i>, producing <i>EH</i> as breadth, therefore <i>EH</i> is rational and commensurable in length with <i>EF</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX22.html>X.22</a></div>
<p>Again, since <i>CD</i> is medial and equals <i>HI</i>, therefore <i>HI</i> is also medial. And it is applied to the rational straight line <i>EF</i>, producing <i>HK</i> as breadth, therefore <i>HK</i> is rational and incommensurable in length with <i>EF</i>.

<p>Since <i>CD</i> is medial, while <i>AB</i> is rational, therefore <i>AB</i> is incommensurable with <i>CD</i>, so that <i>EG</i> is also incommensurable with <i>HI.</i>

<div class="just"><a href=../bookVI/propVI1.html>VI.1</a>,
<a href=propX11.html>X.11</a></div>
<p>But <i>EG</i> is to <i>HI</i> as <i>EH</i> is to <i>HK</i>,  therefore <i>EH</i> is also incommensurable in length with <i>HK</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX36.html>X.36</a></div>
<p>And both are rational, therefore <i>EH</i> and <i>HK</i> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. Therefore <i>EK</i> is a binomial straight line, divided at <i>H</i>.

<p>Since <i>AB</i> is greater than <i>CD</i>, while <i>AB</i> equals <i>EG</i> and <i>CD</i> equals <i>HI</i>, therefore <i>EG</i> is also greater than <i>HI</i>. Therefore <i>EH</i> is also greater than <i>HK</i>. The square, then, on <i>EH</i> is greater than the square on <i>HK</i> either by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with <i>EH</i> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.

<p>First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable with itself.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.II.html#1>X.Def.II.1</a></div>
<p>Now the greater straight line <i>HE</i> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <i>EF</i> set out, therefore <i>EK</i> is a first binomial.

<div class="just"><a href=propX54.html>X.54</a></div>
<p>But <i>EF</i> is rational, and, if an area is contained by a rational straight line and the first binomial, then the side of the square equal to the area is binomial.  Therefore the side of <i>EI</i> is binomial, so that the side of <i>AD</i> is also binomial.

<p>Next, let the square on <i>EH</i> be greater than the square on <i>HK</i> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <i>EH</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.II.html#4>X.Def.II.4</a></div>
<p>Now the greater straight line <i>EH</i> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <i>EF</i> set out, therefore <i>EK</i> is a fourth binomial.

<div class="just"><a href=propX57.html>X.57</a></div>
<p>But <i>EF</i> is rational, and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fourth binomial, then the side of the area is the irrational straight line called major. Therefore the side of the area <i>EI</i> is major, so that the side of the area <i>AD</i> is also major.

<hr width=50%>

<p>Next, let <i>AB</i> be less than <i>CD</i>.  Then <i>EG</i> is also less than <i>HI</i>, so that <i>EH</i> is also less than <i>HK</i>.

<p>Now the square on <i>HK</i> is greater than the square on <i>EH</i> either by the square on a straight line commensurable with <i>HK</i> or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.

<p>First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with itself.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.II.html#2>X.Def.II.2</a></div>
<p>Now the lesser straight line <i>EH</i> is commensurable in length with the rational straight line <i>EF</i> set out, therefore <i>EK</i> is a second binomial.

<div class="just"><a href=propX55.html>X.55</a></div>
<p>But <i>EF</i> is rational, and, if an area is contained by a rational straight line and the second binomial, then the side of the square it is a first bimedial, therefore the side of the area <i>EI</i> is a first bimedial, so that the side of <i>AD</i> is also a first bimedial.

<p>Next, let the square on <i>HK</i> be greater than the square on <i>HE</i> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <i>HK</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.II.html#5>X.Def.II.5</a></div>
<p>Now the lesser straight line <i>EH</i> is commensurable with the rational straight line <i>EF</i> set out, therefore <i>EK</i> is a fifth binomial.

<div class="just"><a href=propX58.html>X.58</a></div>
<p>But <i>EF</i> is rational, and, if an area is contained by a rational straight line and the fifth binomial, then the side of the square equal to the area is a side of a rational plus a medial area.

<p>Therefore the side of the area <i>EI</i> is a side of a rational plus a medial area, so that the side of the area <i>AD</i> is also a side of a rational plus a medial area.

<p>Therefore, <i>if a rational and a medial are added together, then four irrational straight lines arise, namely a binomial or a first bimedial or a major or a side of a rational plus a medial area.</i>
