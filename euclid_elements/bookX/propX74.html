<h1>Proposition 74</h1>

<div class="statement">If from a medial straight line there is subtracted a medial straight line which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a rational rectangle, then the remainder is irrational; let it be called <i>first apotome of a medial</i> straight line.</div>

<p>From the medial straight line <i>AB</i> let there be subtracted the medial straight line <i>BC</i> which is commensurable with <i>AB</i> in square only and with <i>AB</i> makes the rectangle <i>AB</i> by <i>BC</i> rational.

<p>I say that the remainder <i>AC</i> is irrational, and let it be called an apotome of a medial straight line.

<p>Since <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are medial, the squares on <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are also medial. But twice the rectangle <i>AB</i> by <i>BC</i> is rational, therefore the sum of the squares on <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> is incommensurable with twice the rectangle <i>AB</i> by <i>BC</i>.

<div class="just">cf. <a href=../bookII/propII7.html>II.7</a>
<br><a href=propX16.html>X.16</a></div>
<p>Therefore twice the rectangle <i>AB</i> by <i>BC</i> is also incommensurable with the remainder, the square on <i>AC</i>, since, if the whole is incommensurable with one of the magnitudes, then the original magnitudes are also incommensurable.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.I.html#4>X.Def.I.4</a></div>
<p>But twice the rectangle <i>AB</i> by <i>BC</i> is rational, therefore the square on <i>AC</i> is irrational, therefore <i>AC</i> is irrational.  Let it be called a first apotome of a medial straight line.
