<h1>Definition 20</h1>

<div class="statement">Of trilateral figures, an <i>equilateral triangle</i> is that which has its three sides equal, an <i>isosceles triangle</i> that which has two of its sides alone equal, and a <i>scalene triangle</i> that which has its three sides unequal.</div>

<h1>Definition 21</h1>

<div class="statement">Further, of trilateral figures, a <i>right-angled triangle</i> is that which has a right angle, an <i>obtuse-angled triangle</i> that which has an obtuse angle, and an <i>acute-angled triangle</i> that which has its three angles acute.</div>

<h4>About Definition 20</h4>

<p>This definition classifies triangles by their symmetries, while definition 21 classifies them by the kinds of angles they contain.

<p>The scalene triangle <i>C</i> has no symmetries, but the isosceles triangle <i>B</i> has a bilateral symmetry.  The equilateral triangle <i>A</i> not only has three bilateral symmetries, but also has 120&deg;-rotational symmetries.  

<p>According to this definition, an equilateral triangle is not to be considered as an isosceles triangle.  The term isosceles triangle is first used in proposition <a href=propI5.html>I.5</a> and later in Books II and IV.  The way that the term isosceles triangle is used in the <i>Elements</i> does not exclude equilateral triangles.  That agrees with modern practice. It is only required that at least two sides be equal in order for a triangle to be isosceles.

<p>Equilateral triangles are constructed in the very first proposition of the Elements, <a href=propI1.html>I.1</a>.  An alternate characterization of isosceles triangles, namely that their base angles are equal, is demonstrated in propositions <a href=propI5.html>I.5</a> and <a href=propI6.html>I.6</a>.

<p>Since triangle <i>D</i> has a right angle, it is a right triangle.  Proposition <a href=propI17.html>I.17</a> states that the sum of any two angles in a triangle is less than two right angles, therefore, no triangle can contain more than one right angle. Furthermore, there can be at most one obtuse angle, and a right angle and an obtuse angle cannot occur in the same triangle.

<p>Triangle <i>E</i> is an obtuse triangle since it has an obtuse angle, while triangle <i>F</i> is an acute triangle since all its angles are acute.
