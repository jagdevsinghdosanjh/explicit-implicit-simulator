&ldquo;Line&rdquo; is the second primitive term in the <i>Elements.</i>  The description, &ldquo;breadthless length,&rdquo; says that a line will have one dimension, length, but it won&rsquo;t have breadth. The terms length and breadth are not defined in the <i>Elements.</i> In  <a href=defI5.html>I.Def.5</a> a surface is defined with the two dimensions length and breadth, and in <a href=../bookXI/defXI1.html>XI.Def.1</a> a solid is defined with the three dimensions length, breadth, and depth.

<tr><td>
<p>One cannot tell from this definition what kind of line is meant by line, but later a straight line defined to be a special kind of line.  One can conclude, then, that lines need not be straight.  Perhaps &ldquo;curve&rdquo; would be a better translation than line since Euclid meant what is commonly called a curve in modern English, where a curve may or may not be straight. 

<p>Also, from the next definition, it is apparent that Euclid&rsquo;s lines may have ends, so they are line segments or curve segments. But they need not have ends in all cases since the entire circumference of a circle is an example of a line.  Indeed, lines need not be finite in all cases; there are a few instances in the <i>Elements</i> where a line is not bounded, and that is usually indicated by the language.  See, for example, proposition <a href=propI12.html>I.12</a>.

<p>One piece of terminology that Euclid did not mention explicitly in a definition is a phrase to indicate when a line passes through a point.  That would be a primitive relation that could hold between a line and a point.  Postulates would be included as well to give meaning to the phrase as they are in modern treatments of elementary geometry.
