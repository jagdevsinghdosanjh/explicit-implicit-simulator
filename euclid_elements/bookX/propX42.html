<h1>Proposition 42</h1>

<div class="statement">A binomial straight line is divided into its terms at one point only.</div>

<p>Let <i>AB</i> be a binomial straight line divided into its terms at <i>C</i>. Then <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.

<p>I say that <i>AB</i> is not divided at another point into two rational straight lines commensurable in square only.

<p>For, if possible, let it be divided at <i>D</i> also, so that <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> are also rational straight lines commensurable in square only.

<p>It is then manifest that <i>AC</i> is not the same as <i>DB</i>.

<p>If possible, let it be so. Then <i>AB</i> is also  the same as <i>CB</i>, and <i>AC</i> is to <i>CB</i> as <i>BD</i> is to <i>DA</i>. Thus <i>AB</i> is divided at <i>D</i> also in the same way as by the division at <i>C</i>, which is contrary to the hypothesis.

<p>Therefore <i>AC</i> is not the same with <i>DB</i>.

<p>For this reason also the points <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> are not equidistant from the point of bisection.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookII/propII4.html>II.4</a></div>
<p>Therefore that by which the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> differs from the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> is also that by which twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> differs from twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i>, because both the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> together with twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i>, and the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> together with twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i>, equal the square on <i>AB</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX21.html>X.21</a>
<br><a href=propX26.html>X.26</a></div>
<p>But the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> differs from the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> by a rational area, for both are rational, therefore twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> also differs from twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> by a rational area, though they are medial, which is absurd, for a medial area does not exceed a medial by a rational area.

<p>Therefore a binomial straight line is not divided at different points. Therefore it is divided at one point only.

<p>Therefore, <i>a binomial straight line is divided into its terms at one point only.</i>
