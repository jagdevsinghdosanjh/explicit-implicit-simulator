<div class="statement">The edges of a surface are lines.</div>
</div>

<a name=guide><h2>Guide</h2></a>

<p>As in <a href=defI3.html>I.Def.3</a>, this statement describes a certain relationship, but this time between surfaces and lines.  For example, a hemisphere is a surface, and its edge is the circumference of a circle, a kind of line.

<p>This definition cannot actually be used since there are no postulates to go along with it to connect the edges of a surface in any way to the surface.

<p>Euclid uses the same term for the end of a line in <a href=defI3.html>I.Def.3</a>, the edge of a surface in this definition, and the surface of a solid in <a href=../bookXI/defXI1.html>XI.Def.2</a>.  That term could be translated as &ldquo;that which is around,&rdquo; &ldquo;the limits of,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the extremities of,&rdquo; but in English the terms &ldquo;the ends of&rdquo; a line, &ldquo;the edges of&rdquo; a surface, and either &ldquo;the surfaces of&rdquo; or &ldquo;the faces of&rdquo; a solid are fairly standard for different dimensions.
