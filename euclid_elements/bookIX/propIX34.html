<h1>Proposition 34</h1>

<div class="statement">If an [even] number neither is one of those which is continually doubled from a dyad, nor has its half odd, then it is both even-times-even and even-times-odd.</div>

<p>Let the [even] number <i>A</i> neither be one of those doubled from a dyad, nor have its half odd.

<p>I say that <i>A</i> is both even-times-even and even-times-odd.

<p>Now that <i>A</i> is even-times-even is clear, for it has not its half odd.

<p>I say next that it is also even-times-odd.

<p>If we bisect <i>A,</i> then bisect its half, and do this continually, we shall come upon some odd number which measures <i>A</i> according to an even number. If not, we shall come upon a dyad, and <i>A</i> will be among those which are doubled from a dyad, which is contrary to the hypothesis.

<p>Thus <i>A</i> is even-times odd.

<p>But it was also proved even-times-even. Therefore <i>A</i> is both even-times-even and even-times-odd.

<p>Therefore, <i>if an [even] number neither is one of those which is continually doubled from a dyad, nor has its half odd, then it is both even-times-even and even-times-odd.</i>

<h2>Guide</h2>

<p>Numbers which are both even-times-even and even-times-odd are are both divisible by 4 and an odd number.  They are the numbers whose halves are even excluding powers of 2. 

<p>This completes the series of propositions on even and odd numbers that started with <a href="propIX21.html">IX.21</a>.
