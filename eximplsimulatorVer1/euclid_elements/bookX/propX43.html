<h1>Proposition 43</h1>

<div class="statement">A first bimedial straight line is divided at one and the same point only.</div>

<div class="just"><a href=propX37.html>X.37</a></div>
<p>Let <i>AB</i> be a first bimedial straight line divided at <i>C</i>, so that <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle.

<p>I say that <i>AB</i> is not so divided at another point.

<p>If possible, let it also be divided at <i>D</i>, so that <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> are also medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle.

<p>Since, then, that by which twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> differs from twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> is that by which the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> differs from the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i>, while twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> differs from twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> by a rational area, for both are rational, therefore the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> also differs from the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> by a rational area, though they are medial, which is absurd.

<p>Therefore a first bimedial straight line is not divided into its terms at different points. Therefore it is so divided at one point only.

<p>Therefore, <i>a first bimedial straight line is divided at one and the same point only.</i>
