<div class="statement">
When a straight line standing on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is <i>right,</i> and the straight line standing on the other is called a <i>perpendicular</i> to that on which it stands.</div>

<p>
In the figure, the two angles <i>DBA</i> and <i>DBC</i> are equal, so they are right angles by definition, and so the line <i>BD</i> set up on the line <i>AC</i> is perpendicular to it.  Later there will be a postulate (<a href=post4.html>Post.4</a>) which states that all right angles are equal, and after a few propositions, it can be shown that <i>AC</i> is also perpendicular to <i>BD.</i>  There are no postulates that explicitly state perpendiculars exist.  Instead a construction for them is given and proved in proposition <a href=propI11.html>I.11</a>.

<p>The word orthogonal is frequently used in mathematics as a synonym for perpendicular.

<p>This is the first mention in the <i>Elements</i> of magnitudes being equal.  There are several different kinds of magnitudes in the <i>Elements</i> besides angles.  Lines, plane figures, and solids are also kinds of magnitudes.  Some of the assumptions about magnitudes are stated later as common notions <a href=cn.html>C.N.</a>, which are often called axioms. One thing that magnitudes of the same kind can be is &ldquo;equal,&rdquo; as the angles in this definition can be.  Nowhere does Euclid explicitly state what it means for angles to be equal&mdash;or for that matter, for lines, plane figures, or solids to be equal&mdash;although much can be determined by the way he uses equality.
