<h1>Definition 15</h1>

<div class="statement">
A <i>circle</i> is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight lines falling upon it from one point among those lying within the figure equal one another.</div>

<div class="statement">And the point is called the <i>center</i> of the circle.</div>

<div class="theorem">
<h1>Definition 17</h1>

<div class="statement">A <i>diameter</i> of the circle is any straight line drawn through the center and terminated in both directions by the circumference of the circle, and such a straight line also bisects the circle.</div>

<div class="theorem">

<div class="statement">A <i>semicircle</i> is the figure contained by the diameter and the circumference cut off by it.  And the center of the semicircle is the same as that of the circle.</div>

A definition such as this describes what circles are.  Definitions do not guarantee the existence of the things they define.  The existence of circles follows from a postulate, namely, <a href=post3.html>Post.3</a>.

<p>Note that a circle for Euclid is a two-dimensional figure.  But in modern mathematics, usually the word circle refers to what Euclid calls the circumference of a circle.

<p>The center of the circle in the diagram is the point <i>C.</i>  It&rsquo;s interesting that the English word &ldquo;center&rdquo; derives from the Greek word which also means a prod or a poker, and it refers to the fixed leg of a compass used to draw a circle.

<p>There is no assumption in the definition that there is only one center of a circle.  Proposition <a href="../bookIII/propIII1.html">III.1</a> gives a construction for the center of a circle, and the proof of that proposition shows that the center is unique.

<p>The (curved) line <i>ABD</i> that contains the circle is its circumference. Euclid typically names a circle by three points on its circumference. Perhaps a better translation than &ldquo;circumference&rdquo; would be &ldquo;periphery&rdquo; since that is the Greek word while &ldquo;circumference&rdquo; derives from the Latin.

<p>Euclid doesn&rsquo;t have a term for radius other than &ldquo;that from the center,&rdquo; but radius is such a useful word that it is used here to translate &ldquo;that from the center,&rdquo; such as the radius <i>CD.</i>

<p>An example diameter is the line <i>AB</i> which passes through the center.  Of course, a diameter is twice a radius, and since the radii are all equal to each other by definition, the diameters are also all equal to each other.

<p>That diameters &ldquo;also bisects the circle&rdquo; should not be part of the definition, but either assumed as a postulate or proved as a proposition.  It depends on the fact that circles are drawn on planes, and planes have constant curvature.  The analogous figure on a surface of nonconstant curvature does not have this property.  For such figures the two &ldquo;semicircles&rdquo; on either side of a &ldquo;diameter&rdquo; need not be equal.

<p>Although circles are used throughout Book I to measure and transfer distances, the proper theory of circles doesn&rsquo;t begin until <a href=../bookIII/bookIII.html>Book III</a>.  That book begins with more definitions relating to circles including the equality of circles, when circles touch (are tangent to) lines and other circles, and so forth.
