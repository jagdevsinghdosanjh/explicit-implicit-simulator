<h3>Guide</h3>

Euclid didn&rsquo;t a single word for rectangle, but two words meaning right-angled parallelogram.

According to the first definition, the rectangle <i>ABCD</i> illustrated on the left is contained by the lines <i>AB</i> and <i>BC,</i> and this rectangle can be called the rectangle <i>AB</i> by <i>BC.</i>  Of course, it could also be called the rectangle <i>BC</i> by <i>CD,</i> or two other names.

<p>On the right, in the parallelogram <i>EFGH,</i> there is a diameter <i>EG</i> with a parallelogram <i>LNGO</i> about it and the two complements <i>KLOF</i> and <i>MHNL,</i> and these three parallelograms together make up the gnomon.  In other words a gnomon is an L-shaped figure made by removing a parallelogram from a larger similar parallelogram. 

<p>The word <i>gnomon</i> comes from the Greek word meaning carpenter&rsquo;s square. A carpenter&rsquo;s square is an L-shaped tool with its two sides at right angles.  Euclid&rsquo;s use of the word is looser as he doesn&rsquo;t require that the sides be at right angles.

<p>Euclid illustrated gnomons by arcs of circles around the inner vertex.  In this example, the gnomon is called the gnomon <i>PQR.</i>
