<h1>Proposition 79</h1>

<div class="statement">To an apotome only one rational straight line can be annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only.</div>

<div class="just"><a href=propX73.html>X.73</a></div>
<p>Let <i>AB</i> be an apotome, and <i>BC</i> an annex to it.  Then <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.

<p>I say that no other rational straight line can be annexed to <i>AB</i> which is commensurable with the whole in square only.

<div class="just"><a href=propX73.html>X.73</a></div>
<p>If possible, let <i>BD</i> be so annexed.  Then <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> are also rational straight lines commensurable in square only.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookII/propII7.html>II.7</a></div>
<p>Now, since the excess of the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> over twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> is also the excess of the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> over twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i>, for both exceed by the same, the square on <i>AB</i>, therefore, alternately, the excess of the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> over the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> is the excess of twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> over twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX21.html>X.21</a>
<br><a href=propX26.html>X.26</a></div>
<p>But the sum of the squares on <i>AD</i> and <i>DB</i> exceeds the sum of the squares on <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> by a rational area, for both are rational, therefore twice the rectangle <i>AD</i> by <i>DB</i> also exceeds twice the rectangle <i>AC</i> by <i>CB</i> by a rational area, which is impossible, for both are medial, and a medial area does not exceeded a medial by a rational area.

<p>Therefore no other rational straight line can be annexed to <i>AB</i> which is commensurable with the whole in square only.

<p>Therefore only one rational straight line can be annexed to an apotome which is commensurable with the whole in square only.

<p>Therefore, <i>to an apotome only one rational straight line can be annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only.</i>
