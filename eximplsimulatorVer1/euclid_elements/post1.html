<td>This first postulate says that given any two points such as <i>A</i> and <i>B,</i> there is a line <i>AB</i> which has them as endpoints.  This is one of the constructions that may be done with a straightedge (the other being described in the next postulate).
</td></tr></table>

<p>Although it doesn&rsquo;t explicitly say so, there is a unique line between the two points.  Since Euclid uses this postulate as if it includes the uniqueness as part of it, he really ought to have stated the uniqueness explicitly.

<p>The last three books of the <i>Elements</i> cover solid geometry, and for those, the two points mentioned in the postulate may be any two points in space.  Proposition <a href=../bookXI/propXI1.html>XI.1</a> claims that if part of a line is contained in a plane, then the whole line is.  In the books on plane geometry, it is implicitly assumed that the line <i>AB</i> joining <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> lies in the plane of discussion.
