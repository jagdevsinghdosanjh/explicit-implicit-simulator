<h1>Proposition 11</h1>

<div class="statement">To cut a given straight line so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments equals the square on the remaining segment.</div>

<p>Let <i>AB</i> be the given straight line.

<p>It is required to cut <i>AB</i> so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments equals the square on the remaining segment.

<p>Describe the square <i>ABDC</i> on <i>AB.</i>  Bisect <i>AC</i> at the point <i>E,</i> and join <i>BE.</i>  

<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI3.html">I.3</a>

<p>Draw <i>CA</i> through to <i>F,</i> and make <i>EF</i> equal to <i>BE.</i>  Describe the square <i>FH</i> on <i>AF,</i> and draw <i>GH</i> through to <i>K.</i>

<p>I say that <i>AB</i> has been cut at <i>H</i> so that the rectangle <i>AB</i> by <i>BH</i> equals the square on <i>AH.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="propII6.html">II.6</a></div>
<p>Since the straight line <i>AC</i> has been bisected at <i>E,</i> and <i>FA</i> is added to it, the rectangle <i>CF</i> by <i>FA</i> together with the square on <i>AE</i> equals the square on <i>EF.</i>

<p>But <i>EF</i> equals <i>EB,</i> therefore the rectangle <i>CF</i> by <i>FA</i> together with the square on <i>AE</i> equals the square on <i>EB.</i>

<div class="just"><a href="../bookI/propI47.html">I.47</a></div>
<p>But the sum of the squares on <i>BA</i> and <i>AE</i> equals the square on <i>EB,</i> for the angle at <i>A</i> is right,  therefore the rectangle <i>CF</i> by <i>FA</i> together with the square on <i>AE</i> equals the sum of the squares on <i>BA</i> and <i>AE.</i>

<p>Subtract the square on <i>AE</i>  from each. Therefore the remaining rectangle <i>CF</i> by <i>FA</i> equals the square on <i>AB.</i>

<p>Now the rectangle <i>CF</i> by <i>FA</i> is <i>FK,</i> for <i>AF</i> equals <i>FG,</i> and the square on <i>AB</i> is <i>AD,</i> therefore <i>FK</i> equals <i>AD.</i>

<p>Subtract <i>AK</i> from each. Therefore <i>FH,</i> which remains, equals <i>HD.</i>

<p>And <i>HD</i> is the rectangle <i>AB</i> by <i>BH,</i> for <i>AB</i> equals <i>BD,</i> and <i>FH</i> is the square on <i>AH,</i> therefore the rectangle  <i>AB</i> by <i>BH</i> equals the square on <i>HA.</i>

<p>Therefore the given straight line <i>AB</i> has been cut at <i>H</i> so that the rectangle  <i>AB</i> by <i>BH</i>  equals the square on <i>HA.</i>

This construction cuts a line into two parts to solve the equation <i>a</i> (<i>a</i>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<i>x</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> geometrically.

<p>This construction is used in the proof of <a href=../bookIV/propIV10.html>IV.10</a>, which is later used to construct a regular pentagon.  It accomplishes the same thing as the construction of proposition <a href=../bookVI/propVI30.html>VI.30</a>, which cuts a line into extreme and mean ratio, defined in <a href=../bookVI/defVI3.html>VI.Def.3</a>, and that construction is used
later in <a href=../bookXIII/propXIII17.html>XIII.17</a>.

<tr><td>
<p>The difference between this proposition and VI.30 is a matter of terminology.  Propositions dealing with ratios of lines are postponed until Book VI, but any ratio concerning lines can be converted into a statement about areas of rectangles.  Proposition <a href=../bookVI/propVI16.html>VI.16</a> states that the line <i>A</i> is to the line <i>B</i> as the line <i>C</i> is to the line <i>D</i> is equivalent to the statement that the rectangle <i>A</i> by <i>D</i> equals the rectangle <i>B</i> by <i>C.</i>

<p>The construction of this proposition cuts a line into two parts <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> so that the rectangle <i>A</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>B</i> by <i>A</i> equals the square <i>B</i> by <i>B.</i>  The construction in VI.30 cuts a line so that <i>A</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>B</i> : <i>B</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>B</i> : <i>A,</i> which by VI.16, or by its special case <a href=../bookVI/propVI17.html>VI.17</a>, is the same thing.

<h4>Construction steps</h4>

<p>For the purposes of cutting the line <i>AB,</i> the entire diagram does not have to be constructed.  The points <i>D, G,</i> and <i>K</i> are unnecessary.  In the diagram to the right, only those lines and circles necessary for the construction are shown, and only those parts of them that are relevant.

<p>Altogether, there are six circles to be drawn, two lines connected, and one line extended. In order, they are as follows. Extend <i>BA</i> and draw a circle centered at <i>A</i> with radius <i>AB</i> to determine the point <i>L.</i> Draw circles centered at <i>B</i> and <i>L</i> with radius <i>BL</i> to determine points <i>M</i> and <i>N.</i>  Draw the straight line <i>MN.</i> Then <i>C</i> is where it meets the circle centered at <i>A.</i>  Draw a circle centered at <i>C</i> with radius <i>CA,</i> and connect the two points where it meets the circle centered at <i>A.</i>  Then <i>E</i> is where that line meets <i>AC.</i>  Draw the circle centered at <i>E</i> with radius <i>EB</i> to determine <i>F.</i>  Draw the circle centered at <i>A</i> with radius <i>F</i> to determine <i>H,</i> the desired point to cut <i>AB.</i></td>

<h4>The golden ratio, the 36&deg;-72&deg;-72&deg; triangle, and regular pentagons</h4>

This is the first of several propositions in the <i>Elements</i> that treats these concepts. At this point, ratios have not been introduced, so Euclid describes it in basic terms, that a given straight line is cut so that &ldquo;the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments equals the square on the remaining segment.&rdquo;
