<h1>Proposition 2</h1>

<div class="statement">
If two straight lines cut one another, then they lie in one plane; and every triangle lies in one plane.
</div>

<p>For let the two straight lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> cut one another at the point <i>E.</i>

<p>I say that <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> lie in one plane, and that every triangle lies in one plane.

<p>Take the points <i>F</i> and <i>G</i> at random on <i>EC</i> and <i>EB,</i> join <i>CB</i> and <i>FG,</i> and draw <i>FH</i> and <i>GK</i> across.

<p>I say first that the triangle <i>ECB</i> lies in one plane.

<p>For, if part of the triangle <i>ECB,</i> either <i>FHC</i> or <i>GBK,</i> is in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, then a part also of one of the straight lines <i>EC</i> or <i>EB</i> is in the plane of reference, and a part in another.

<div class="just"><a href="propXI1.html">XI.1</a></div>
<p> But, if the part <i>FCBG</i> of the triangle <i>ECB</i> is in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, then a part also of both the straight lines <i>EC</i> and <i>EB</i> is in the plane of reference and a part in another, which was proved absurd.

<p> Therefore the triangle <i>ECB</i> lies in one plane.

<div class="just"><a href="propXI1.html">XI.1</a></div>
<p> But, in whatever plane the triangle <i>ECB</i> lies, each of the straight lines <i>EC</i> and <i>EB</i> also lies, and in whatever plane each of the straight lines <i>EC</i> and <i>EB</i> lies,  <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> also lie.

<p> Therefore the straight lines <i>AB</I> and <i>CD</i> lie in one plane; and every triangle lies in one plane.

<p>Therefore, <i>if two straight lines cut one another, then they lie in one plane; and every triangle lies in one plane. </i>

<h2>Guide</h2>

The goal of the proof in this proposition is to produce a plane for the two lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> to lie in. Yet the proof fails to produce any plane at all.  Near the beginning is the phrase &ldquo;the plane of reference&rdquo; occurs, but there is no reference as no planes have been mentioned.  As the two lines <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> could be placed anywhere in space, any previously conceived plane would be irrelevant to them.

<p>Postulates of some sort are needed to justify the existence of planes. One could state that three noncollinear points determine a plane. Another might be that there are four noncoplanar points.

<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>

This proposition is used in the proofs of propositions <a href=propXI4.html>XI.4</a>, <a href=propXI6.html>XI.6</a>, and <a href=../bookXII/propXII17.html>XII.17</a>.
