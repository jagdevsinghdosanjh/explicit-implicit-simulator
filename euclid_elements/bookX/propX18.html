<h1>Proposition 18</h1>

<div class="statement">If there are two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there is applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less but falling short by a square, and if it divides it into incommensurable parts, then the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater.  And if the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater, and if there is applied to the greater a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less but falling short by a square, then it divides it into incommensurable parts.</div>

<div class="just"><a href=propX17.html#lemma>X.17,Lemma</a></div>
<p>Let <i>A</i> and <i>BC</i> be two unequal straight lines, of which <i>BC</i> is the greater, and to <i>BC</i> let there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less, <i>A</i>, but falling short by a square. Let this be the rectangle <i>BD</i> by <i>DC</i>, and let <i>BD</i> be incommensurable in length with <i>DC</i>.

<p>I say that the square on <i>BC</i> is greater than the square on <i>A</i> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <i>BC</i>.

<p>With the same construction as before, we can prove similarly that the square on <i>BC</i> is greater than the square on <i>A</i> by the square on <i>FD</i>.

<p>It is to be proved that <i>BC</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>DF</i>.</td>

<p>Since <i>BD</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>DC</i>, therefore <i>BC</i> is also incommensurable in length with <i>CD</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX6.html>X.6</a>,
<a href=propX13.html>X.13</a>
<br><a href=propX16.html>X.16</a></div>
<p>But <i>DC</i> is commensurable with the sum of <i>BF</i> and <i>DC</i>, therefore <i>BC</i> is incommensurable with the sum of <i>BF</i> and <i>DC</i>,  so that <i>BC</i> is also incommensurable in length with the remainder <i>FD</i>.

<p>And the square on <i>BC</i> is greater than the square on <i>A</i> by the square on <i>FD</i>, therefore the square on <i>BC</i> is greater than the square on <i>A</i> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <i>BC</i>.

<hr width=50%>

<p>Next, let the square on <i>BC</i> be greater than the square on <i>A</i> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <i>BC</i>.  Apply to <i>BC</i> a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on <i>A</i> but falling short by a square. Let this be the rectangle <i>BD</i> by <i>DC</i>.

<p>It is to be proved that <i>BD</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>DC</i>.

<p>With the same construction, we can prove similarly that the square on <i>BC</i> is greater than the square on <i>A</i> by the square on <i>FD</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX16.html>X.16</a></div>
<p>But the square on <i>BC</i> is greater than the square on <i>A</i> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <i>BC</i>, therefore <i>BC</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>FD</i>, so that <i>BC</i> is also incommensurable with the remainder, the sum of <i>BF</i> and <i>DC</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX6.html>X.6</a>,
<a href=propX13.html>X.13</a>
<br><a href=propX16.html>X.16</a></div>
<p>But the sum of <i>BF</i> and <i>DC</i> is commensurable in length with <i>DC</i>, therefore <i>BC</i> is also incommensurable in length with <i>DC</i>, so that, taken separately, <i>BD</i> is also incommensurable in length with <i>DC</i>.

<p>Therefore, <i>if there are two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there is applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less but falling short by a square, and if it divides it into incommensurable parts, then the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater.  And if the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the greater, and if there is applied to the greater a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less but falling short by a square, then it divides it into incommensurable parts.</i>

This proposition is a logical variant of the last.  It is used in frequently in Book X starting with <a href=propX33.html>X.33</a>.
