<h1>Proposition 16</h1>

<div class="statement">If two incommensurable magnitudes are added together, the sum is also  incommensurable with each of them; but, if the sum is incommensurable with one of them, then the original magnitudes are also incommensurable.</div>

<p>Let the two incommensurable magnitudes <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> be added together.

<p>I say that the whole <i>AC</i> is also incommensurable with each of the magnitudes <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>.

<p>For, if <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i> are not incommensurable, then some magnitude  <i>D</i> measures them.

<p>Since then <i>D</i> measures <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i>, therefore it also measures the remainder <i>BC</i>. But it also measures <i>AB</i>, therefore <i>D</i> measures <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>.  Therefore <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are commensurable, but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable, which is impossible.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.I.html#1>X.Def.I.1</a></div>
<p>Therefore no magnitude measures <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i>. Therefore <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i> are incommensurable.

<p>Similarly we can prove that <i>AC</i> and <i>CB</i> are also incommensurable. Therefore <i>AC</i> is incommensurable with each of the magnitudes <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>.

<p>Next, let <i>AC</i> be incommensurable with one of the magnitudes <i>AB</i> or <i>BC</i>.

<p>First, let it be incommensurable with <i>AB</i>.

<p>I say that <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are also incommensurable.

<p>For, if they are commensurable, then some magnitude <i>D</i> measures them. 

<p>Since, then, <i>D</i> measures <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>, therefore it also measures the whole <i>AC</i>. But it also measures <i>AB</i>, therefore <i>D</i> measures <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i>. Therefore <i>CA</i> and <i>AB</i> are commensurable, but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable, which is impossible.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.I.html#1>X.Def.I.1</a></div>
<p>Therefore no magnitude measures <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i>. Therefore <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are incommensurable.

<p>Therefore, <i>if two incommensurable magnitudes are added together, the sum is also  incommensurable with each of them; but, if the sum is incommensurable with one of them, then the original magnitudes are also incommensurable.</i>

This proposition is a logical variant of the previous one, but it is proved afresh.  It is used in several others in Book X starting with <a href=propX18.html>X.18</a>.
