<h1>Proposition 1</h1>

<div class="statement">
A part of a straight line cannot be in the plane of reference and a part in plane more elevated. 
</div>

<p>For, if possible, let a part <i>AB</i> of the straight line <i>ABC</i> be in the plane of reference, and a part <i>BC</i> be in a plane more elevated.

<p>Then there is in the plane of reference some straight line continuous with <i>AB</i> in a straight line.  Let it be <i>BD.</i>  Therefore <i>AB</i> is a common segment of the two straight lines <i>ABC</i> and <i>ABD,</i> which is impossible, since, if we describe a circle with center <i>B</i> and radius <i>AB,</i> then the diameters cut off unequal circumferences of the circle.

<p>Therefore, <i>a part of a straight line cannot be in the plane of reference and a part in plane more elevated. </i>

<h2>Guide</h2>

Not only is the proof of this proposition unclear, so is the statement of it.  The meaning of the &ldquo;plane of reference&rdquo; and the role it is to play in solid geometry are unclear.  Is the intent of the statement that if part of a line lies in a plane, then all of it does?  At least that would be a meaningful statement.

<p>The proof of this proposition is unclear for more than one reason. Before a circle with center <i>B</i> and radius <i>AB</i> can be described, a plane has to be specified in which to describe the circle.  In space there are infinitely many circles that have the same center <i>B,</i> the same radius <i>AB,</i> and even contain the point <i>A.</i>  Indeed, this possibility of many circles with with same diameter was used to define a sphere in definition <a href="defXI14.html">XI.Def.14</a>.  The last statement about unequal circumferences is incomprehensible.

<p>The problem is that there are no postulates for solid geometry.  The <a href="../bookI/bookI.html#posts">postulates</a> in Book I apparently refer to an ambient plane.  Certainly <a href="../bookI/post3.html">Post.3</a>, &ldquo;to describe a circle with any center and radius,&rdquo; and <a href="../bookI/post5.html">Post.5</a> (which refers to interior angles when one line crosses two others) do.  Without any postulates for nonplanar geometry it is impossible for solid geometry to get off the ground. 

<h4>Use of this proposition</h4>

This proposition is used in the proof of the next one as well as others in the last three books of the <i>Elements.</i>
