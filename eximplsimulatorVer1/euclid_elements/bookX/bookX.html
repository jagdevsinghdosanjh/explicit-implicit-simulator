<dd>Those magnitudes are said to be <i>commensurable</i> which are measured by the same measure, and those <i>incommensurable</i> which cannot have any common measure.

<p><dt><a href=defX.I.html#2><b>Definition 2.</b></a>
<dd>Straight lines are <i>commensurable in square</i> when the squares on them are measured by the same area, and <i>incommensurable in square</i> when the squares on them cannot possibly have any area as a common measure.

<p><dt><a href=defX.I.html#3><b>Definition 3.</b></a>
<dd>With these hypotheses, it is proved that there exist straight lines infinite in multitude which are commensurable and incommensurable respectively, some in length only, and others in square also, with an assigned straight line. Let then the assigned straight line be called <i>rational</i>, and those straight lines which are commensurable with it, whether in length and in square, or in square only, <i>rational</i>, but those that are incommensurable with it <i>irrational</i>.

<p><dt><a href=defX.I.html#4><b>Definition 4.</b></a>
<dd>And the let the square on the assigned straight line be called <i>rational</i>, and those areas which are commensurable with it <i>rational</i>, but those which are incommensurable with it <i>irrational</i>, and the straight lines which produce them <i>irrational</i>, that is, in case the areas are squares, the sides themselves, but in case they are any other rectilineal figures, the straight lines on which are described squares equal to them.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX1.html>Proposition 1.</a></b>
<dd>Two unequal magnitudes being set out, if from the greater there is subtracted a magnitude greater than its half, and from that which is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if this process is repeated continually, then there will be left some magnitude  less than the lesser magnitude set out.  And the theorem can similarly be proven even if the parts subtracted are halves.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX2.html>Proposition 2.</a></b>
<dd>If, when the less of two unequal magnitudes is continually subtracted in turn from the greater that which is left never measures the one before it, then the two magnitudes are incommensurable.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX3.html>Proposition 3.</a></b>
<dd>To find the greatest common measure of two given commensurable magnitudes.

<dd>To find the greatest common measure of three given commensurable magnitudes.
</font color>

<p><b><a href=propX4.html#cor>Corollary.</a></b>  If a magnitude measures three magnitudes, then it also measures their greatest common measure. The greatest common measure can be found similarly for more magnitudes, and the corollary extended.

<dd>Commensurable magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX6.html>Proposition 6.</a></b>

<dd>Incommensurable magnitudes do not have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX8.html>Proposition 8.</a></b>
<dd>If two magnitudes do not have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number, then the magnitudes are incommensurable.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX9.html>Proposition 9.</a></b>
<dd>The squares on straight lines commensurable in length have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number; and squares which have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number also have their sides commensurable in length. But the squares on straight lines incommensurable in length do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number; and squares which do not have  to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number also do not have their sides commensurable in length either.

<p><b><a href=propX9.html#cor>Corollary.</a></b>  Straight lines commensurable in length are always commensurable in square also, but those commensurable in square are not always also commensurable in length.

<p><b><a href=propX9.html#lemma>Lemma.</a></b>  Similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, and if two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, then they are similar plane numbers.

<p><b><a href=propX9.html#cor2>Corollary 2.</a></b>  Numbers which are not similar plane numbers, that is, those which do not have their sides proportional, do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number

<p><dt><a href=defX.III.html#1><b>Definition 1.</b></a>
<dd>Given a rational straight line and an apotome, if the square on the whole is greater than the square on the annex by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with the whole, and the whole is commensurable in length with the rational line set out, let the apotome be called a <i>first apotome.</i>

<p><dt><a href=defX.III.html#2><b>Definition 2.</b></a>
<dd>But if the annex is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, and the square on the whole is greater than that on the annex by the square on a straight line commensurable with the whole, let the apotome be called a <i>second apotome.</i>

<p><dt><a href=defX.III.html#3><b>Definition 3.</b></a>
<dd>But if neither is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, and the square on the whole is greater than the square on the annex by the square on a straight line commensurable with the whole, let the apotome be called a <i>third apotome.</i>

<p><dt><a href=defX.III.html#4><b>Definition 4.</b></a>
<dd>Again, if the square on the whole is greater than the square on the annex by the square on a straight line incommensurable with the whole, then, if the whole is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, let the apotome be called a <i>fourth apotome</i>;

<p><dt><a href=defX.III.html#5><b>Definition 5.</b></a>
<dd>If the annex be so commensurable, a <i>fifth</i>;

<dd>A straight line commensurable with that which produces a medial area and a medial whole is itself also a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX108.html>Proposition 108.</a></b>
<dd>If from a rational area a medial area is subtracted, the side of the remaining area becomes one of two irrational straight lines, either an apotome or a minor straight line.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX109.html>Proposition 109.</a></b>
<dd>If from a medial area a rational area is subtracted, then there arise two other irrational straight lines, either a first apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX110.html>Proposition 110.</a></b>
<dd>If from a medial area there is subtracted a medial area incommensurable with the whole, then the two remaining irrational straight lines arise, either a second apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produce with a medial area a medial whole.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX111.html>Proposition 111.</a></b>
<dd>The apotome is not the same with the binomial straight line. 

<p><b><a href=propX111.html#prop>Proposition.</a></b> The apotome and the irrational straight lines following it are neither the same with the medial straight line nor with one another.  There are, in order, thirteen irrational straight lines in all: 
<ul>
Medial
<br>Binomial
<br>First bimedial
<br>Second bimedial
<br>Major
<br>Side of a rational plus a medial area
<br>Side of the sum of two medial areas
<br>Apotome

<p><dt><b><a href=propX112.html>Proposition 112.</a></b>
<dd>The square on a rational straight line applied to the binomial straight line produces as breadth an apotome the terms of which are commensurable with the terms of the binomial straight line and moreover in the same ratio; and further the  apotome so arising has the same order as the binomial straight line.

<p><dt><b><a href=propX113.html>Proposition 113.</a></b>
<dd>The square on a rational straight line, if applied to an apotome, produces as breadth the binomial straight line the terms of which are commensurable with the terms of the apotome and in the same ratio; and further the binomial so arising has the same order as the apotome.

<dd>If an area is contained by an apotome and the binomial straight line the terms of which are commensurable with the terms of the apotome and in the same ratio, then the side of the area is rational.

<p><b><a href=propX114.html#cor>Corollary.</a></b>  It is possible for a rational area to be contained by irrational straight lines.
