<h1>Proposition 68</h1>

<div class="statement">A straight line commensurable with a major straight line is itself also major.</div>

<p>Let <i>AB</i> be major, and let <i>CD</i> be commensurable with <i>AB</i>.

<p>I say that <i>CD</i> is major.

<p>Divide <i>AB</i> at <i>E</i>.  Then <i>AE</i> and <i>EB</i> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational but the rectangle contained by them medial.

<p>Make the same construction as before.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV11.html>V.11</a></div>
<p>Since <i>AB</i> is to <i>CD</i> as <i>AE</i> is to <i>CF</i>, and <i>EB</i> is to <i>FD</i>, therefore <i>AE</i> is to <i>CF</i> as <i>EB</i> is to <i>FD</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX11.html>X.11</a></div>
<p>But <i>AB</i> is commensurable with <i>CD</i>, therefore <i>AE</i> and <i>EB</i> are commensurable with <i>CF</i> and <i>FD</i> respectively.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV16.html>V.16</a>
<br><a href=../bookV/propV18.html>V.18</a></div>
<p>Since <i>AE</i> is to <i>CF</i> as <i>EB</i> is to <i>FD</i>, alternately, also <i>AE</i> is to <i>EB</i> as <i>CF</i> is to <i>FD</i>, therefore, taken jointly, <i>AB</i> is to <i>BE</i> as <i>CD</i> is to <i>DF</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookVI/propVI20.html>VI.20</a></div>
<p>Therefore the square on <i>AB</i> is to the square on <i>BE</i> as the square on <i>CD</i> is to the square on <i>DF</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookV/propV16.html>V.16</a></div>
<p>Similarly we can prove that the square on <i>AB</i> is to the square on <i>AE</i> as the square on <i>CD</i> is to the square on <i>CF</i>. Therefore the square on <i>AB</i> is to the squares on <i>AE</i> and <i>EB</i> as the square on <i>CD</i> is to the squares on <i>CF</i> and <i>FD</i>, therefore, alternately, the square on <i>AB</i> is to the square on <i>CD</i>, so are the squares on <i>AE</i> and <i>EB</i> to the squares on <i>CF</i> and <i>FD</i>.

<p>But the square on <i>AB</i> is commensurable with the square on <i>CD</i>, therefore the squares on <i>AE</i> and <i>EB</i> are also commensurable with the squares on <i>CF</i> and <i>FD</i>.

<p>And the squares on <i>AE</i> and <i>EB</i> together are rational, therefore the squares on <i>CF</i> and <i>FD</i> together are rational.

<p>Similarly also twice the rectangle <i>AE</i> by <i>EB</i> is commensurable with twice the rectangle <i>CF</i> by <i>FD</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=propX23.html#cor>X.23,Cor.</a></div>
<p>And twice the rectangle <i>AE</i> by <i>EB</i> is medial, therefore twice the rectangle <i>CF</i> by <i>FD</i> is also medial.

<div class="just"><a href=propX39.html>X.39</a></div>
<p>Therefore <i>CF</i> and <i>FD</i> are straight lines incommensurable in square which make, at the same time, the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial, therefore the whole <i>CD</i> is the irrational straight line called major.

<p>Therefore a straight line commensurable with the major straight line is major.

<p>Therefore, <i>a straight line commensurable with a major straight line is itself also major.</i>
