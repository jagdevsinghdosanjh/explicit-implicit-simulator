<p>I say that <i>AC</i> is irrational, and the side of the square equal to it is irrational, and let the latter be called medial.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.I.html#4>X.Def.I.4</a></div>
<p>Describe the square <i>AD</i> on <i>AB</i>.  Then <i>AD</i> is rational.

<p>And, since <i>AB</i> is incommensurable in length with <i>BC</i>, for by hypothesis they are commensurable in square only, while <i>AB</i> equals <i>BD</i>, therefore <i>DB</i> is also incommensurable in length with <i>BC</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=../bookVI/propVI1.html>VI.1</a>,
<a href=propX11.html>X.11</a></div>
<p>And <i>DB</i> is to <i>BC</i> as <i>AD</i> is to <i>AC</i>, therefore <i>DA</i> is incommensurable with <i>AC</i>.

<div class="just"><a href=defX.I.html#4>X.Def.I.4</a></div>
<p>But <i>DA</i> is rational, therefore <i>AC</i> is irrational, so that the side of the square <i>AC</i> is also irrational.

<p>Let the latter be called <i>medial</i>.

<a name=guide><h2>Guide</h2></a>

<p>The two lines <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are rational lines. That means, according to Definition 3, that each is commensurable in square to some unmentioned, standard straight line.  It&rsquo;s convenient to assign that standard line a length of 1 and the standard square on it a square of area 1.  Euclid did not, but doing so allows us to assign lengths to those lines.  So if <i>a</i> is the length of <i>AB</i>, that means <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> is a rational number, that is, a ratio of two whole numbers.  Likewise, if <i>b</i> is the length of <i>BC</i>, then <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> is a rational number.

<p>Now <i>AB</i> and <i>BC</i> are also commensurable in square only.  First of all, they&rsquo;re commensurable in square, so the squares on them are in a numeric ratio, and that means <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>b</i><sup>2</sup> is a rational number, which we already know since both <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> and <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> are rational numbers themselves.  But they&rsquo;re also commensurable in square <i>only</i>.  That means that <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> is an irrational number.  In summary, <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> and <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> are rational, but <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> is irrational.

<p>In the proof, it&rsquo;s noted that the rectangle <i>AC</i> (which is a <i>a</i> by <i>b</i> rectangle), is irrational, that is, <i>ab</i> is an irrational number.  The side of a square equal equal to that rectangle is also irrational, and it&rsquo;s called <i>medial</i>.  The length of that side is &radic;(<i>ab</i>).

<p>Another way of saying that is that the length  &radic;(<i>ab</i>) of a medial line is the geometric mean of two numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> whose squares are rational and whose ratio is irrational.  

<h4>Example and interpretation</h4>

<p>Let <i>AB</i> be the standard line and <i>BC</i> be the diagonal of the standard square, then &radic;(<i>ab</i>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;&radic;(&radic;2), the 4<sup>th</sup> root of 2.  

<p>In fact, all medial lines have lengths 4<sup>th</sup> roots of rational numbers whose square roots are irrational.  If <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> and <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> are rational numbers but <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> is an irrational number, then &radic;(<i>ab</i>) is a number whose fourth power, <i>a</i><sup>2</sup><i>b</i><sup>2</sup>, is a rational number but whose square, <i>ab</i>, is an irrational number.

<p>Thus, we could call a number whose square is an irrational number but whose fourth power is a rational number a <i>medial number</i>.

<h4>Medial squares and rectangles</h4>

<p>Only medial lines were defined in this proposition, but the adjective medial is applied to squares and rectangles starting with Proposition <a href=propX24.html>X.24</a>.  From the way it is used, we can tell that a <i>medial</i> square is one whose side is a medial line, and a medial rectangle is one equal to a square whose side is a medial line.

<h4>Use of this proposition.</h4>

<p>This proposition is used frequently in Book X starting with the next proposition.
